The potential difference in a uniform electric field
$$E = - \frac{\Delta V}{d}$$
where $\Delta V$ is the difference in potential

and for spherical symmetric electric field you get
$$E_{r} = - \frac{dV}{dr} <=> \Delta V$$

(also a partial derivative is taking the derivative of say X while thinking Y and Z are constants, then taking the derivative of the original equation Y with X and Z as constants, and comparing the derivatives to make conclusions)

## Conductors
For conductors, the field inside of it will always be neutral and for just outside the conductor you can simplify it to $$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}$$

### Overall you can consider any conductor an equipotential surface

## Caps
If you place a dielectric film in-between your two plates, the electric field strength will decrease (not big surprise). Placing caps in parallel adds all the $C$'s, but placing them in series makes you add all the $\frac{1}{C}$.

Whenever you connect a capacitor to a circuit it will charge until it hits the circuits maximum $\Delta V$

### Capacitance
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
$$C = \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d}$$

#### Plate capacitor with dialectic
$$C = \kappa * \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d}$$
(kappa is the dialectic constant)

### Surface charge of a conductor
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}$$

### Energy density
$$u_{e} = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}E^{2}$$
$$u_{e} = \frac{1}{2}c \Delta V^{2}$$
