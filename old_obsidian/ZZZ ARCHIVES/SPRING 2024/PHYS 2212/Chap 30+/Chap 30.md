Stationary charges create electric fields, that is just Coulombs law.

Current is created by moving charges with a magnetic field

So moving charges (Or Current) create magnetic fields (Biot-Savart Law)

# Faraday's Law of Induction
A current in the primary coil produces a magnetic field when the switch is closed, so the current is only due to the change in magnetic field thru the secondary coil

The emf induced is directly proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux.
$$\epsilon = -N \frac{d\phi_{B}}{dt}$$

or more simply

$$\epsilon = NBAw sin(wt)$$

with $w = 2\pi f$ and $f$ being 60 hz in US

# Self-Induction and Inductance
![[Pasted image 20240404110530.png]]
- Induced emf/currents generate from flux/fields
- When S is closed, i produces a field thru the loop
- and as i increases so does the emf it induces
- This value is equal to $E_{L}$

##### This induced emf is proportional to the rate of change in current
$$E_{L} = -L \frac{di}{dt}$$

###### But for a series of closely spaced loops/coil of N turns
$$L = \frac{N\phi_{B}}{i}$$
or something like this
$$L = \mu_{0}n^{2}V$$
$L$ being in henrys
$\mu_{0}$ being a constant
$n = \frac{N}{l}$ or turns per meter
$V = Al$
