#### Review
Quick formula for energy stored in a capacitor
$$U_{e} = \frac{Q^{2}}{2C} = \frac{1}{2}C(\Delta V)^{2}$$
Ight cool review over

## Resistance and Resistivity
Resistivity is a material property and constant* and is just the inverse of a materials conductivity
$$p = p_{0}[1 + a(T - T_{0})]$$
\*except when the temperature changes (also $T_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ are the default/base resistivity at room temp)

And that is different from the actual resistance which is
$$R = p \frac{l}{A}$$

## Current density
Also charge density is just $\frac{I}{A}$ with $A$ being cross-sectional area

## Electron velocity drift
### $$I = nq_{e}v_{d}A$$

### This is can be re arranged to 
$$v_{d} = \frac{I}{nq_{e}A}$$

#### n being the free electron density (number of electrons in ya shit) is equal to 
$\frac{N_{A}p}{M}$

with $N_{A}$ being Avogadro's constant $6.022 * 10^{23}$ and $M$ being your molar mass in like $\frac{grams}{mol}$

#### $A$ is your cross sectional area
$A = \pi r^{2}$

#### $q_{e}$ is also your elementary electron charge 
Elementary charge of an electron: $q_{e}$ =  $1.602 * 10^{-19}$

## Fukin watts or somethin
#### Resistor power draw
$$P = I \Delta V = I^{2}R$$

#### Electromotive Force (emf)
Battery: source of electromotive force (emf)
Electromotive force is an unfortunate historical term describing potential  
difference in volts.

##### Electromotive force is not a FORCE

Its the max potential difference between the two ends of the battery when resistance of the circuit is **0**, and because they are real and entropy exists, they have internal resistance, thus the EMF of a battery is equal to

$$\epsilon = I (R + r)$$
and we can derive potential and current from this
$$V = \epsilon - Ir$$
$$I = \frac{\epsilon}{R + r}$$

###### Including power again
$$P_{total} = I \epsilon$$


## Resistor calcs
Its the inverse of caps

### Series
In series, current is common => $I_{1} = I_{2} = I$
thus $V = V_{1} + V_{2} = IR_{1} + IR_{2} = I (R_{1} + R_{2})$
or simply $V = I \Sigma R_{i}$

### Parallel
In parallel, voltage is common => $I = I_{1} + I_{2} = \frac{V}{R_{1}} + \frac{V}{R_{2}}$
or simply $\frac{1}{R} = \Sigma\frac{1}{R_{i}}$

# Multi Loop circuit
Basically
$$\Delta V_{1} + \Delta V_{2} ... + \Delta V_{i} = 0$$
or like
$$(IR_{1}) + (\epsilon) + (IR_{2}) = 0$$

# Charging
So the time it takes for a cap to charge in an RC circuit is about
$$\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\epsilon}{R} - \frac{q}{RC}$$
or 
$$q(t) = C \epsilon (1 - e^{\frac{-t}{RC}})$$

Example

# Discharging
And for discharging, you find the I initial with this guy
$$I_{inital} = \frac{\Delta V_{c}}{R} = \frac{Q_{inital}}{RC}$$
$$-\Delta V_{c} - iR = 0 => i = -\frac{\Delta V_{c}}{R}$$
$$q(t) = Q_{inital} * e^{\frac{-t}{RC}}$$
