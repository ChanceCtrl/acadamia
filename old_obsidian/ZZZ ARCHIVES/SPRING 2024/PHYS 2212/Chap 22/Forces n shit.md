# Coulomb’s Law
The electrostatic force between two charges is analogous to the gravitational force between two masses.

## HOWEVER
Gravity ⇒ always attractive
Coulomb Force => attractive or repulsive

## Coulomb Force
$$F_{e} = k_{e}\frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$$
$k_{e} = 8.99 * 10^{9} \frac{Nm^{2}}{C^{2}}$

## Gravitational Force
$$F_{g} = G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$$

# The Concept of the Field
Earth’s gravitational field exerts a force of attraction on nearby masses. Gravitational field strength (g) at a point in space is the gravitational force of attraction per unit mass is equal to

$$g = \frac{F_{g}}{m} = \frac{GM}{R^{2}}$$

And its direction is always towards the center of earth.

Particles behave in a similar way, but its "gravity" isn't defined by mass

## Motions of a charge particle in an electric field
**Net force: **
$$\Sigma \vec F = q\vec E = m\vec a$$

**The acceleration: **
$$\vec a = \frac{q\vec E}{m}$$

## Electric Field due to a charge distribution
### The electric field at P due to a small charge element $\Delta q$
$$\Delta \vec E = k_{e} \frac{\Delta q}{r^{2}}$$

### The field at P due to the whole distribution
$$\vec E == k_{e} \Sigma_{i} \frac{\Delta q_{i}}{r_{i}^{2}} \vec r_{i}$$

$$k_{e} \int \frac{dq}{r^{2}} \vec r$$

## Charge density of uniform distributions
### Volume Charge Density:
$$p = \frac{Q}{V}$$
$$dq = pdV$$

### Surface Charge Density:
$$\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}$$
$$dq = \sigma dA$$

### Linear Charge Density:
$$\lambda = \frac{Q}{l}$$
$$dq = \lambda dl$$

# Gauss's law
If there are many charges inside the closed surface, then the charge of the surface is equal to the sum of all the charges inside of the surface.
$$\phi_{E} = \int \vec E.d\vec A = \frac{q_{1}}{e_{o}} + \frac{q_{2}}{e_{o}} + \frac{q_{i}}{e_{o}}$$

## Flux
is the amount of "stuff flowing through a given surface area"

## Electric Flux
Is a measure of electric field lines passing through a surface. 

### For any given flat area 
$$\phi_{E} = EAcos\theta$$
(the cos makes it perpendicular)

### And for non flat continuous surfaces 
$$\phi_{E} = \int \vec E.d\vec A$$

### Also for a closed surface
$$\int E_{n} dA$$

## Gaussian Surfaces
A (hypothetical) closed surface with an electric field thru it.

### Gaussian Sphere
![[Pasted image 20240123120153.png]]
The field at any point on the sphere
$$E = k_{e} \frac{q}{r^{2}}$$

The flux on the surface of it (the sum of all charges inside the surface)
$$E \int dA = q_{1}$$

## Some handy short hand stuffs
1. $\vec E$ constant over the portion of a surface.
2. $\vec E$ and $d\vec A$ parallel: $\vec E.d\vec A = E dA$
3. $\vec E$ and $d\vec A$ perpendicular: $\vec E. d\vec A = 0$
4. $\vec E = 0$ over portion of a surface.
