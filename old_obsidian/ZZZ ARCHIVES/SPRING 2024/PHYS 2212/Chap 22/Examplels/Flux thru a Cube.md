Consider a uniform electric field $\vec E$ oriented in the X direction in empty space. A cube of length $l$ is placed in the field, oriented as shown in the figure. Find the net electric fox through the surface of the cube.

Surface 1
$$\int_{1}\vec E * d\vec A = \int_{1}(cos180)dA = -\int_{1}EdA = -EA = -El^{2}$$

Surface 2
$$\int_{2}\vec E * d\vec A = \int_{1}(cos0)dA = E\int_{2}dA = +EA - El^{2}$$

Surfaces 3,4,5,6
$$\int_{3,4,5,6} \vec E * d\vec A = 0$$

Now solve by summing all surface fluxes
$$-E l^{2} + El^{2} + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0)$$

$$= 0$$
