Charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are located on the x axis, at distances $a$ and $b$, receptively, from the origin as shown in the figure

1. Find the components of the net electric field at the point P which is at position (0, y).
$$E_{1} = \frac{k_{e}|q_{1}|}{r_{1}^{2}}$$
$$E_{2} = \frac{k_{e}|q_{2}|}{r_{2}^{2}}$$

$$E_{x} = E_{1}cos\phi + E_{2}cos\theta$$
$$E_{y} = E_{1}sin\phi - E_{2}sin\theta$$

2. Evaluate the electric field at point P in the special case that $|q_{1}| = |q_{2}|$ and $a = b$.
$$E_{1} = E_{2} = \frac{k_{e}\E}{y^{2} + a^{2}}$$


3. Find the electric field due to the electric dipole when point P is a distance $y >> a$ from the origin.
$$E_{net} = 2E_{1}cos\theta = 2k_{e} \frac{q}{y^{2} + a^{2}} a/(\sqrt{y^{2}+a^{2}})$$

$$ 2k_{e} = \frac{qa}{y^{3}}$$
