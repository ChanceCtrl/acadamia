Consider three point-charges located at the corners of a right triangle as shown in the figure where $q_{1} = q_{3} = 5.00 C, q = -2.00 C$, and $a = 0.1m$. Find the resultant force exerted on $q_{3}$

Between 1 and 3
$$F_{13} = \frac{(8.99*10^{9})(5.00)(5.00)}{(\sqrt{2}*0.1)^{2}}$$

Between 2 and 3
$$F_{23} = \frac{(8.99*10^{9})(2.00)(5.00)}{0.100^{2}}$$
