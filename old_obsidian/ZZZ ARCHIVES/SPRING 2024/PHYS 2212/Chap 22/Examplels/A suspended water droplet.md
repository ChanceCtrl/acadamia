A water droplet of mass $3.00 * 10^{-12}$ *kg* is located in the air near the ground during a stormy day. An atmospheric electric field of magnitude $6.00 * 10^{3}$ *N/C* points vertically downward in the vicinity of the water droplet. The droplet remains suspended at rest in the air. what is the electric charge on the droplet?

$$\Sigma F_{y} = 0 -> F_{e} - F_{g} = 0$$

$$q(-E) - mg = 0$$

$$q = \frac{-mg}{E}$$
