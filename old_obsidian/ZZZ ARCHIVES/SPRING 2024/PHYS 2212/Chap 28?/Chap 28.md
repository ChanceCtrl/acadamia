## Electric fields can form magnetic fields 
First discovered in 1819 during a lecture demonstration.

Hans Christian Oersted saw a deflection of a compass needle near a wire carrying an electric current

## Biot-Savart Law
#### permeability of free space
$$u_{0} = 4\pi * 10^{-7} \frac{Tm}{A}$$

uhhhhh

### Magnetic Fields Due to Currents
$$dB = \frac{u_{0}I}{4\pi a} cos\Theta  d \Theta$$
$$B = \frac{u_{0}I}{4\pi a} \int cos\Theta d \Theta$$

Or the shrimplest
$$B = \frac{u_{0}I}{4\pi a} (sin\Theta_{2} - sin\Theta_{1})$$

## Ampere's Law
If you've got a closed path, then $\int \vec B * d \vec s = u_{0}I$

## The guy or something
The total magnetic flux thru the rectangular loop
$$\Phi_{B} = \frac{u_{0}Ib}{2\pi} ln(1 + \frac{a}{c})
