# Bias
Bias is the degree to which a procedure systematically fucks with the numbers. The goal is to be unbiased to do good science. But most can't whether they realize or not.

1. **Voluntary response bias**
	When people *choose* to participate in a something. Often leads to a more extreme answers to things as they are the only ones who car
2. **Self-interest bias**
	If the person doing the study has a *vested interest* in the outcome being good/bad.
3. **Social acceptability bias**
	*People* don't like being the outlier, and thus *will lie* if it makes them seem better.
4. **Leading question bias**
	More or less "Dark patterns" from games *leading you* to an answer *with its structure*
5. **Nonresponse bias**
	If a large group of people are probed but *none of a particular group respond*, they maybe prevented by something.
6. **Sampling bias**
	The most common one to manipulate, and when they just drop things they don't like to screw with the numbers
