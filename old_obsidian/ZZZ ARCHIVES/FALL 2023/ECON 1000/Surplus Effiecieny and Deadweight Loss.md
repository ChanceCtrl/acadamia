# Conditions
- No single buyer or seller can influence the price.
- Information must be available at a low cost
- No [[Externality]]s

# Economic Goals for Society
- To produce at a level where D(MSB) = S(MSC)
- Recognize that trade off exists
	- IE more of something is not always better

# [[Dead Weight Loss]]

## Too Little Trade
- If a product helps society its a positive [[Externality]].
- During underproduction demand (MSB) is higher than supply (MSC) leading to a lack of equilibrium - [[Dead Weight Loss]]
- Maximum possible level of Total Social Surplus has shrunk.
- The realized level of total social surplus is now the Orange & Green the red area is DWL.
