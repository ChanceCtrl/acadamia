"Total market value" -> Refer to total dollar value at current prices

"Of all final" -> To avoid "double counting" _intermediate goods_ receive different treatment

"Goods and services" -> ???

"Produced" -> Does not include all items sold this year, but rather all items produced this year

"Within a society" -> All economic activity which is taking place 'within' a geographic border

"Over a period of time" -> Includes all production during a period of time (usually in a year)

At 6% interest, your money takes 72/6 or 12 years to double.

# Calculation of [[GPD]]

## Add together the value of every final good produced by using the following equation

### $$GDP = (P_{i}*Q_{i})+(P_{i+1}*Q_{i+1}) + ...$$

## Method 2
#### Consumption (C): Purchases of newly produced [[Finished G&S]] by [[Firms]]
#### Investment (I): Purchases of newly produced [[Finished G&S]] by [[Households]]
#### Government Purchases (G): Purchases of newly produced [[Finished G&S]] by local, state, or federal government
#### Net Exports (NX): Total exports of [[Finished G&S]] from the society

### $$Y = C+I+G+NX$$

## Income Approach
### National Income is approximately = GDP
- Nation income (NI) is the total market value of all [[Finished G&S]] that are produced within a country (+) overseas income for a particular period, normally one year.
- Gross Domestic Product [[GPD]] is the total market value of all the [[Finished G&S]] are produced within a country over a certain period of time.

## Output Approach 
### Sums the "value-added" at each stage of production, where: Value-added = (Cost of Output - Cost of Input)

## Why aren't stock purchases and sale counted in [[GPD]]?
- In short, its a piece of paper, not a [[Factors of Production]] or [[Finished G&S]].

## Difficulties in Measuring [[GPD]]
1. Used Goods (not counted)
2. Non-Market Production (professionals, volunteers and homemakers not counted)
3. Underground Economy (illicit buying/selling of stolen goods, drugs, copyright etc are hard to track)

## What is the difference between nominal & real [[GPD]]
- Nominal GDP: Total value of all [[Finished G&S]] produced in a given time period, usually quartly/annually. Computed using 'current-year' prices
- Real GDP: ???

## Real [[GPD]] Per Capita (PPP)
- PPP = Real GDP / total population.
- PPP is an excellent indicator of the average economic standard of living.

# Determinants of long run growth
- Extensive (discover new stuff) vs Intensive (use stuff better)
- Labor & Capital Ratio (depends on the right mix of labor & capital)
- Technology
- Physical Capital
- Investment of Capital Goods vs Consumption 

## Investment of Capital Goods
- Play a vital role in increasing production in the long run.
- Consumer goods have little-to-no future productive use. 

# Possible Barriers to Development
- Viciuous-Cycle-of-Poverty Hypothesis
	- Poor countries have insufficient resources available to make the investments in capital
- Capital Flight
	- Assest/money rapidly flow out of a country
- Brain-Drain
	- High export of intelligent people, and little coming in
- History of Exploitation
	- [[Capitalist Systems]]
- Government Failure
	- Gov. intervention creates inefficiency & waste of scare resources.
- Unfavorable "Rule-of-Law"
	- Not ALL persons, institutions, and entities are accountable to laws.
- Investor's Fear of Expropriation
	- Gov. takeover of privately owned property.
- Crony Capitalism
	- Mutually advantageous relationship between business leaders and gov. officials.
