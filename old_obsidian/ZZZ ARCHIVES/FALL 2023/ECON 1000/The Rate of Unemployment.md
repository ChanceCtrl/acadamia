There are two things, price floor & ceiling, if either value does not allow for the market to sit at equilibrium, it will be considered "binding".
![[Price Floor]]
![[Price Ceiling]]

# [[The Business Cycle]]
## Recessions
(contractionary) is identified by 
- Negative economic growth
- Growth in unemployment (may lag due to informational delays)

## Boom
(expansionary) is identified by
1. Positive economic growth
2. Reduction in unemployment

## Time Lags
Congress takes time to write, debate, pass and implement legislation
- Unemployment (recession) is a lagging indicator due to 'Informational Delays'
- Due to Informational Delays, it takes time for businesses to
	- Preform internal analysis
	- engage in cost-saving measures
	- make layoffs

# What does it mean to be unemployed/employed

## Labor Force
The total number of employed + unemployed

## Relevant Population
Civilians over the age of sixteen who are non-institutionalized

## Total population
All people living in the nation

## Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
$$\frac{Labor-Force}{Relevant-Population}*100$$
## Unemployment rate
$$\frac{Unemployment-Rate}{Labor-Force}*100$$

# Things not included in the unemployment rate
- Underemployed workers (seeking a better job)
- Marginally attached workers (looking for over a year, but not recently)
- Discouraged works (marginally attached workers who have given up)

# Possible reasons for unemployment
- Job searching and matching (skill issue)
- Efficiency wages (instead of equilibrium, too much labor)
- High minimum wages
- Changes in [[The Business Cycle]] (get fucked lmao)

# Types of Unemployment
- Frictional (unemployment result from workers who quit to find better work)
- Structural (skill issue)
- Cyclical ([[The Business Cycle]] says get fucked lmao)

# The Natural Rate of Unemployment = Frictional + Structural

## Misery Index is calculated almost like [[Stagflation]]
(unemployment rate + inflation rate + stagnant economic growth), except it excludes stagnant economic growth
