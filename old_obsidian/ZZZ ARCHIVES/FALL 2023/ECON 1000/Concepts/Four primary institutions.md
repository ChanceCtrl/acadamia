1. [[Households]]
	- Most fundamental part of every economic system
	- primary suppliers of [[Factors of Production]].
	- Ultimate consumers of most finished G&S's
	- Rational decision makers: do their best to achieve their goals, given the "rules of the game."
2. [[Firms]]
	- Institutions that transform [[Factors of Production]] into G&S's
	- Firms may be owned/operated privately, cooperatively, collectively, or socially.
	- The main object of privately owned firms: "Profit".
2. Markets
	- All potential buyers & all potential sellers of a G&S
	- Only institution that is *not* a "decision-maker"
	- "Invisible hand" suggests interactions of exchange between "buyers" and "sellers."
4. Government
	- Decision making institution with legal authority to impose restrictions & mandates on behavior.
	- Plays a critical role in defining & enforcing property rights and contracts. (ex: regulates business, provides G&Ss for taxes.)
