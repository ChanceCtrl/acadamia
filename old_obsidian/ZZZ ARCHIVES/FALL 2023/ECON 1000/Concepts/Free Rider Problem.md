- Public goods face a free rider problem due to
**non rival** one person's use of the good does not reduce the amount available to others and **non-exludable** difficult to prevent people from using the light house
- If gov. fails to supply a public good & the free-market does so instead, the amount traded would be less than the efficient quantity

##### How to correct for this inefficiency
Government can supply/maintain public goods
- Economic question of (what, how, and for whom ([[3 Fundamental Economic Questions]])) are answered by the political process.
- Taxes are imposed to cover costs of production
- Not a guarantee of efficiency, rather a a safeguard against it
