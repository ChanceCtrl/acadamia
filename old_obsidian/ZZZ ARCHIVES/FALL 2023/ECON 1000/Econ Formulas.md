## [[The Rate of Inflation]]
### CPI
$$CPI_{t}= \frac{Cost-of-today's-Market-Basket}{Cost-of-Market-basket-last-year}$$
### Inflation via CPI
$$Inflation-Rate = \frac{CPI_{new}-CPI_{old}}{CPI_{old}}*100$$
### Nominal to Real
$$ Real-value = \frac{Nominal-value}{Price-index}$$
## Quantity Theory of Money Equation
### (M \* V = [[GPD]] = P \* Q)
M = Money supply
V = Velocity of money  (number of times that the dollar changes hands)
P = average Price level
Q = Quanity/output of [[Finished G&S]] produced in a given yr.
