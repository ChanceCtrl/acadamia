Economics is a social science that studies how people make decisions in the face of [[Scarcity]], as well as how these decisions impact individuals and society as a whole.

[[MicroEconomics]]: Trees are a metaphor for an individual market.

[[MacroEconomics]]: Forest is a metaphor for the 'whole' economy.

## Do Economists agree on anything?
On March 11, 2010, 40+ economists wrote a letter supporting the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obama Care.

And 140+ Said nahh fam that shit wack

### 2 Possible reasons 
1. Differences in "scientific judgments" of how shit works (positive statements)
	- **How** should we be taxed?
2. Differences in values (normative statements)
	- **Should** we be taxed at all?

#### Benefits & Costs
are associated with different courses of action
#### Total Benefits
"sum" of all gains that a person realizes from an action
#### Total Costs
"sum" of all burdens that a person incurs from an action or outcome
#### Total Economic Surplus
difference between total benefits & total costs.
#### Rational Decision Maker
chooses the course of action with the largest Economic Surplus


# QUESTION: 
## How Does A Rational Decision Maker Maximize Total Economic Surplus?
# ANSWER: 
## Employ the COST-BENEFIT PRINCIPLE

- Undertake an activity if & only if pros outweigh the cons
# [[Marginal Benefit & Cost]]
- What is the right amount of pizza slices to consume?
- Need to know the marginal benefit and marginal cost.
- Use the table to compute the marginal benefit & cost.

# Incentive principle
- If the BM of an activity increases, then a rational person will engage in more of the activity

Attend College or not
- Median annual income in 2012 with a BA was 55,432
- Median annual income in 2012 with a HS diploma was 33,904
- If the the difference were only 5,000, would you still go?
- Incentive principle suggests that one would be less likely to go since it hardly outweighs the MC
# Self-Interested Individual
- Adam Smith explains that the best economic benefit for all when individuals act in their own self-interest as only then would they be able to help others. And its bullshit.
