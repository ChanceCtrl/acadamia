# How is the Market Basket determined?
- Surveys 200+ [[Finished G&S]] of typical Items brought by an average family in a month

# Consumer price index (CPI)
- Measures overall change in consumer prices of a market basket in the current year

$$CPI_{t}= \frac{Cost-of-today's-Market-Basket}{Cost-of-Market-basket-last-year}$$

# Use CPI to calculate the "Inflation Rate"
$$Inflation-Rate = \frac{CPI_{new}-CPI_{old}}{CPI_{old}}*100$$

## CPI limitations
1. Market-basket examinations are infrequent & may overstate changes in overall price level
2. CPI does not account for changes in quality
3. CPI only includes "out of pocket" & not total cost (eg healthcare)
4. CPU is only a snapshot of the measurement of the cost-of-living

## Other price indexes
### Producer Price Index (PPI)
Measures averrage change in prices over time that domestic producers receive for their output

### Implicit GDP Deflator:
User to adjust (deflate) nominal [[GPD]] (ie Nominal to Real [[GPD]])


## CPI vs PPI
### Similarity
PPI & CPI are indices that measure the changes in pricing over time for various categories of [[Finished G&S]].

## Convert Nominal values to real values

$$ Real-value = \frac{Nominal-value}{Price-index}$$

## What happens to your wealth if prices for [[Finished G&S]] rise, while your income remains constant?
- reduces the purchasing power of the dollar.
- Nominal income is the amount written on your paycheck
- Real income is what you can purchase once inflation is considered 

# Costs of Inflation to Society
###### **Shoe Leather** (during Germany's hyperinflation (1921-1923), merchants hired runners to bring cash to convert into another more stable currency)
- Wear & Tear caused by extra running around takes places when places are trying to avoid holding onto cash
- High inflation discourages people from saving money because the purchasing power of the cash you hold onto steadily erodes as the price level increases
- Fuck

## Supply shocks can affect inflation
### 1. Positive Supply Shock
- Increase output, causing price to decrease
	- Ex. Scientist discover a new way to extract oil, this increase in supply leads to oil prices to decline, which reduces inflation.
### 2. Negative Supply Shock
- Decrease output, causing price to rise
	- OPEC's decision to raise oil prices increases output costs and forces people to cut their output, leading to oil prices to increase, which stimulates inflation

## Demand Pull inflation
- Overheated economy with excessive spending but same amount of goods
- Examples
	- Rapid rise in aggregate demand (AD)
	- As AD rises faster than producers can supply, this leads to shortages
	- Shortages lead to higher prices
	- Thus giving inflation
- Demand shock resulting from a rise in aggregate demand (AD)
- Prices raise as output rises and unemployment falls

## Cost Push inflation
- Result of a "negative supply shock"
- Increases the cost of production and forces producers to increase prices
- Example
	- Lmao no

## Commodity Money
1. is something that has intrinsic value. eg milk, cheese, yogart etc
2. Performs the function of money to buy [[Finished G&S]] without the complications (Dual coincidence of wants) of the barter systems

### Barter system
- Under the barter system, an exchange is only possible if there is a double coincidence of wants
- In this story we notice that no exchange of goods take place because their requirements do not match

## Fiat Money
- Is something that serves as money but has no other important uses (eg $100 bills)
- Has its value due to decree and legislation by the government
- Are found in most world economies

### Gold Standard
Country fixes the value of its currency in terms of a specific amount of gold
#### Two rules were enforced under the gold stadard
1. No paper money will be printed without hold in the gov.'s vault as security
2. Anyone holding paper money has the right to redeem it for a fixed quantity of gold from the issuing government

#### Main drawbacks to the Gold Standard
##### Deflationary pressures
- Gold moves from one country to another during recessions.
- Gold is not mined fast enough to counteract deflation when it occurs
##### Preiodic crises
- Goverments would likely abandon the gold standard (eg during wars) and promise to reinstate the standard afterwads (this leads to volatility in prices and instablilty in the economy)
- Central banks were left with few tools to engage in... fucjckas

# Inflation
## A general increase in the price level.

## Hyperinflation
An extremely high rate of inflation, generally above 100% per year.

# Deflation
## A general decrease in the price level.
- Can be thought of as "negative inflation"

# Stagflation
![[Stagflation]]

# Disinflation:
## A reduction in the rate of inflation
- Disinflation is just a lower rate of inflation directly following a period of higher inflation

## Deflation is unstable because as prices fall & nominal [[GPD]] shrinks
- The real burden of debts rises as
- Financial institutions viability is severely impaired or destroyed
- Employment falls
- Consumption and investment collapse
- Another round of further deflation continues the cycle
Simply put, it is a more attractive to "risk some inflation that to allow deflation to intensify"

# Quantity Theory of Money Equation
## (M * V = [[GPD]] = P * Q)
M = Money supply
V = Velocity of money  (number of times that the dollar changes hands)
P = average Price level
Q = Quanity/output of [[Finished G&S]] produced in a given yr.

# Unemployment Rate
There are two things, price floor & ceiling, if either value does not allow for the market to sit at equilibrium, it will be considered "binding".
![[Price Floor]]
![[Price Ceiling]]
