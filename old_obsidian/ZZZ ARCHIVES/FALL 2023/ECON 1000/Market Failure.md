# Goals
1. Market failures resulting from "free markets"
2. Several ways government can potentially correct market failures
3. Consider several relevant factors related to market failure

![[Free Market]]

We are a mixed system as pure socialism/capitalism is impossible

# Four market structures
## Key difference
Level of Market power grated to the [[Firms]]

### Seller with market power has some control over the price of its output if it
1. loses some (but not all) customers if it slightly increases price
2. Must decrease price if want to increase quantity sold

## Barriers to entry
1. Resource Ownership (eg Pre-WW2 the international nickel company of Canada owned most of the words nickel)
2. Natural Barriers (eg special tax benefits to existing firms)
3. Legal Protection (eg tariffs, quotas, embargoes, subsidies)

## Requirements of Perfect Competition
- Number (many byters & sellers)
- Barrier to entry (Very low (get in and get out easy))
- Types of substitutes (Very good (identical product))
- Basis of Competition (Price only)
- Pricing Power (none (firms are price takers not setters))
- Relatively small market share.
- Buyers know the nature of the product and prices of the product
- No price discrimination
- No selling cost/no [[Externality]]s
- Firms aim to maximize profits

### The closest to this is the agricultural market

## Monopolistic Competition
- Number (high)
- Barriers to entry (low)
- Types if substitutes (differentiation)
- Basic of Competition (marketing, quality & price)
- Pricing Power (little)
- Imperfect information (buyer & seller have different information)
- Firms are independent decision-makers
- Price makers

### Think fast food

## Oligopoly
- Number (low)
- Barriers to entry (High)
- Types of substitutes (Differentiation)
- Fuck

### Think Android vs IOS

### 'Differentiation' in Oligopoly
Competing brands are almost homogeneous, but typically engage in considerable 'non price competition' supported by 'heavy advertising' to maintain something

## Monopoly
- Number (One)
- Barriers to Entry (Very High)
- Types of Substitutes (None)
- Basis of Competition (Advertising alone)
- Pricing Power (Significant)
- Price setter
- Many monopolies are government licensed or franchised

### ![[Cartel]]

### 1. Maximize Profit
- Monoploy maximizes profit by choosing the quantity at which marginal revenue equals margin l cost (MR = MC)
- It then uses the demand curve to find the price that will induce consumers to buy that quantity
- Produce only when MR intersects MC and charge the max the demand can

# Economies of Scale
## Why does Economies of Scale Occur?
Firms employ more/better use of
1. Mass production techniques
2. [[Specialization]]

# How does Government attempt to regulate monopolies
- Antitrust legislation (Sherman antitrust act)
- Overseeing natural monopolies 
- Encouraging competition


## Excludability
People can be prevented from using a good

## Rivalry
One person's use of  the good diminishes another's ability to use it.

### Private goods
Excludable & rival in consumption (ie ice cream cone)

### Public goods
Non-excludable & non-rival (ie Tornado siren)

#### ![[Free Rider Problem]]

#### ![[Tragedy of the commons]]

### Common resources
Non-excludable but rival in consumption (ie fish in the ocean)

### Club goods
Non-rival but excludable (ie Satellite TV)

# What is the "optimum" amount of pollution in society?
- Tempting to answer, "none or zero pollution is optimum"
- Lmao he flipped slides Im finna kms

## Asymmetric Information
Types of decisions regarding transactions where a party is well informed compared to another. 

### Is there a role for gov to regulate product quality?
YES - easily justified if consumers must incur substantial cots to become more informed about product quality.

# Government can attempt to correct market failures by
1. Preventing monopoly formation
2. Providing public goods
3. Regulating through gov intervention
4. Taxing market participants to avoid [[Negative externality]]s
5. Undoing asymmetry of information amount buyers and sellers

## ALL OF THIS IS TO PREVENT [[Dead Weight Loss]].
