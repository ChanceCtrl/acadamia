# Production Possibilities Frontier
Model that shows the combinations of the two goods a society can produce.

## The PPF Allows us to answer the following Questions:
1. What Quantities can be produced
2. How efficiently they can be produced 

Any combo of points inside the PPF/PPC curve is inefficient, any point on the PPF/PPC is 100% efficient, and anything outside is impossible. The goal of this chart is to minimize [[Opportunity Cost]]. 

# In a modern society, why do people engage in a great deal of specialization?
"Specialization in Production" allows -
- Society to Produce;
- Individuals to consume;
- Greater amount of G&S.

# Specialization
- Who should specialize in what productive activity?
	- Generally, we analyze each producer's opportunity cost and consider what they would be best as

# Absolute Advantage
- A producer possess **Absolute Advantage** in the production of the good is s/he/it can produce more output than another producer with the same number of inputs.

# Comparative advantage
- One nation can produce something more efficient than another thing that another nation can produce for them.

|       | Apples            | Pears              |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Cindy | 1(A) costs 4 (P)  | 1(P) costs 0.25(A) |
| Dave  | 1(A) costs .66(P) | 1(P) costs 1.5(A)  |

So Cindy will make all pears and Dave will make all the Apples, as that is the lowest cost to the both of them.

# Productive Efficiency
G&S are produced at their lowest possible resource - [[Opportunity Cost]]
- Ex. All points on the PPF are points of maximum PRODCUTIVE EFFEICIENCY
- No more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs
