# Gini Coefficient
Numerical measure of income inequality (between 0 (no inequality) and 1 (one person owns the economy))

THE GINI COEFFICIENT DOES NOT MEASURE QUALITY OF LIFE

IT ONLY MEASURES INCOME INEQUALITY

# Poverty Thresholds

## The Poverty Rate
Its the percentage of the population below the poverty threshold

## Technology & Ecnominc growth has made the gap between the rich and poor far less extreme today than 200 years ago
"Most Americans who are considered 'poor' today have routine access to a quality of housing, food, healthcare, consumer products, entertainment, communications, and transportation that even the Vanderbilt's, the Carnegie, the Rockefeller, and the 19th century prices with all their wealth, could not have"

# Redistribution
Policies designed to alter the levels of consumption or income of households within a society (usually from rich to poor)
- Redistribution in-kind
	- Transfer of [[Finished G&S]] (medicaid, WIC, SNAP)
- Income support
	- Transfer of money - Earned income tax credit [EITC] & Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
- Universal Basic Income
	- Provide everyone in society with a lump-sum payment in regular intervals, regardless of their income, resources or employment status (eg Finland)

## Rawlsian Justice
The Maximin Criterion

### "Social contract" designed behind a "veil of ignorance" would aim to "maximize the well-being of the worst-off member of society"

"Value of a product should be measured by the amount of labor used to produce the good rather than allowing the market to place a value on the good"

Probably be government intervention.

Argues that redistribution polices disincentive individuals from doing well

## Libertarian Justice
Argument that prioritize "equality of opportunities" over "equality of outcomes" by preserving free markets and "negative rights"

- Libertarians favor small government, free markets, "negative rights" (eg permit inaction) and generally opposed to redistribution.
- "Fairest distribution" of income and consumption is when the government establishes and enforces some laws or something ahhh
