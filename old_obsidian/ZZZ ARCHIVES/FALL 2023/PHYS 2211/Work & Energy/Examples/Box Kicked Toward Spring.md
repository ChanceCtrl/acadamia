A 2kg box is kicked to slide on a horizontal surface toward a spring. The box has a speed of 4m/s when it is d = 2m away from the free end of the spring. The box hits the spring and compresses it by 20cm. Given that the spring constant is k = 400 N/m, determine $\mu_{k}$.

$$U_{i} + K_{i} + W_{NC} = U_{f} + K_{f}$$
$U_{i} = 0$ as spring is not compressed, $K_{i} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}_{i}$, $W_{NC} = ?$, $U_{f} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$
$\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2} + W_{NC} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$ ***=>*** $W_{NC} = 8 - 16 = 8j$

$$W_{NC} = W_{f} = -f(d+x) = -\mu_{k}N(d+x) = -\mu_{k}mg(d+x) = -8j$$
