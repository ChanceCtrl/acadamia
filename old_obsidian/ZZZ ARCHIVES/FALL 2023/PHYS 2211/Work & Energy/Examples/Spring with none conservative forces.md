A dart of mass 20g is launched vertically upward using a spring of k = 500 N/m as shown in the picture assume that the dart gets to a height of h = 1m. 

A) Is the mechanical energy of the system you considered in part (a) concerved?
$U_{i}+K_{i}=K_{f}+U_{f}$ => $U_{i} + 0 =K_{f}+U_{f}$

Change in length = $5-1 = 4cm = 0.04m$

$E_{mech} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} = \frac{1}{2}(500)(0.04)^{2}$ => $j = 0.4j$


B) What is the work done by the frictional forces
$$W_{NC} = \Delta E_{mech} = -0.2j$$
