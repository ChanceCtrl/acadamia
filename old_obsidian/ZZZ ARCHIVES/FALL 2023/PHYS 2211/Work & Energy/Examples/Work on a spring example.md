A 500g box sliding on a horizontal friction less surface runs into a fixed spring with k = 200 N/m, compressing and then coming to rest. If the initial speed of the box were 2 m/s, what is X?

$$E_{mec} = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$

$$K_{i} + U_{i} = K_{f} + U_{f}$$
$$U_{i} = 0,   K_{f} = 0, K_{i} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}, U_{f} =  \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$

$$\frac{1}{100} = x^{2} => x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{100}}$$
