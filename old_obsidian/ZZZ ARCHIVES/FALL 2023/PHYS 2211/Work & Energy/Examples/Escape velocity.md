$$U = -GmM_{e} \frac{1}{r}$$

The attraction force of earth and the rocket will be zero only at infinity. So, we should send the rocket to infinity! The minimum launch speed means it goes to infinity and just stop there. Meaning: $U_{f} + K_{f} = 0$

Conservation of mechanical energy says something idk he flipped slides
