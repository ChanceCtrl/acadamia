A 3kg block slides down a curved ramp, starting from rest at the height h = 75cm. The speed of the object at the bottom of the ramp is 3 m/s.

a) Is the mechanical energy of the system conserved?
$U_{g} = mgy$
$mgh + 0 = E_{mechi} = 3*10*0.75 = 22.5 j$
$E_{mechf} = 0 + \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}_{f} = \frac{1}{2} * 3 * 9 = 13.5 j$
$W_{NC} = 13.5 - 22.5 = -9j$

b) What is the change in the internal energy of the system? What is the system by the way?

$$\Delta E_{int} = -W_{f} = 9j$$
