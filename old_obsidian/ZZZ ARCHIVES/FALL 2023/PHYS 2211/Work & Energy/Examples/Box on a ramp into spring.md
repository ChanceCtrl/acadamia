An object is at hieght H on a curved ramp as shown in the picture. A spring of strength k is placed at the pottom of the ramp waiting to catch the object, suck that the free end of the spring is right where the curve of the ramp flattens. The object is released from rest and it compresses the spring by a length d.

a) Find the work done by the force of friction during the motion of the object from the top of the ramp to the point the spring has maximum compression.

$$U_{i} + K_{i} + W_{NC} = U_{f} + K_{f}$$

$$mgh + 0 + W_{NC} = \frac{1}{2}kd^{2} + 0$$

$$W_{NC} = \frac{1}{2}kd^{2} - mgh$$

b) Provided that the coefficient of friction between the object and the surface is $\mu_{k}$, determine the speed of the object at the bottom of the ramp just before it touches the spring in terms of mass M, distances h and d, and the coefficient of friction $\mu_{k}$

$$U_{i} + K_{i} + W_{NC} = U_{f} + K_{f}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \mu_{k}(d) = \frac{1}{2}kd^{2}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}kd^{2} + \mu_{k}(d)$$
$$mv^{2} = kd^{2} + 2\mu_{k}(d)$$
$$v^{2} = \frac{kd^{2} + 2\mu_{k}(d)}{m}$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{kd^{2} + 2\mu_{k}(d)}{m}}$$
