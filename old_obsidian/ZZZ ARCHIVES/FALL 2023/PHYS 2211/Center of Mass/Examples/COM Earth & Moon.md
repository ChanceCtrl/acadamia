The Earth and Moon are **384400** km apart on average. How far is the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system from the center of the Earth? Assume both are uniform spheres.
$$M_{e} = 5.97 * 10^{24} \text{ kg}$$
$$M_{m} = 7.35 * 10^{22} \text{ kg}$$

$$X_{CM}= \frac{M_{e}x_{e}+M_{m}x_{m}}{M_{e}+M_{m}}$$

We set local coordinate system to center of earth

$$ => \frac{M_{m}x_{m}}{M_{e}+M_{m}} = \frac{(7.35 * 10^{22})(3.844*10^{8})}{5.97*10^{29}+7.35*10^{22}}$$
