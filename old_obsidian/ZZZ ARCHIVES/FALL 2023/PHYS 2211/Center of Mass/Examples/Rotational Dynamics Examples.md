# No gravity
Friction-less rod rotating about a point, with a 2N force exerted is exerted at the center of the rod perpendicularly. Mass of ball on end of rod 800g. Rod is 50cm long.

Acceleration
$$\vec \tau = I\vec \alpha$$
$$0.5 = I\alpha = mr^{2}\alpha$$
$$\alpha = \frac{1}{.4} = \frac{2.5\text{rad}}{s^{2}}$$

Work
$$k = \frac{1}{2}(mr^{2})(7.5^{2})$$

# Moment of inertia
Its a rod of length L with a mass on the end and another mass at 2L/3
$$I = I_{1} + I_{2} + I_{rod}$$
$$I = m_{1}L^{2} + m_{2}(\frac{2L}{3})^{2} + \frac{ML^{2}}{12}$$

# Disk
Mass-less string wrapped around a disk of **4 kg** and radius of **10 cm**. The string is pulled with a force of **10 N**. Assume that the string does not slip and that the disk **starts at rest, how fast is the disk spinning after 5 seconds?**

$$w = \alpha t + w_{i}$$

$$\tau = rFsin\phi$$
$$\tau = 1$$

$\tau = I \alpha$
$$I = mr^{2}$$
$1$ = $mr^{2} \alpha$
$$1 = (4)(.1)^{2} \alpha$$
$$2.5 = \alpha$$

$$(0.1)(10) = \frac{1}{2}4(.1)^{2} \alpha$$
