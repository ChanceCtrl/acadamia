# Alex
Alex is spinning a traditional well wheel about its axel at a constant pace. He spins it 8 revolutions in 5 seconds.

a) Find the angular speed of the well wheel.
$\Delta t = 5s$, $\Delta \theta = 8 * 2\pi = 16 \pi$
$$w = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{16\pi}{5}$$ in rad/s

b) fuck

# Alex 2 
Alex had well wheel go down again but now it starts from rest and completes 3 revolutions after 3 seconds. Assume constant acceleration.
$$w = \alpha t + w_{i}$$
$$6\pi = \frac{1}{2}\alpha(9) + 0$$
$$\alpha = \frac{12\pi}{9}$$


# Earth
Can we caclulate the angular speed of the Earth?
We already have $\Delta \theta$ and $\Delta t$ so
$$w = \frac{2\pi \text{(1 rotation)}}{24\text{ hours}}$$

# Some other wheel
A wheel with **R = 0.4m** rotates about a fixed axle with a rope on it. Starting from rest at **t = 0**, the rope is pulled with a constant acceleration **a = 4m/s^2**. What is the tangential acceleration of the yellow point at a distance **r = .25m** from the center?
$$a = Rx => \alpha = \frac{4}{0.4} = 10 \frac{rad}{s^{2}}$$
$$a` = rx = 0.25 * 10 = 2.5 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$$

Now how many revolutions will the wheel complete after 10 seconds?
$$\Delta \theta = \frac{1}{2}at^{2} + w_{i}t$$
$$\Delta \theta = \frac{1}{2}(10)(100) = 500 \text{ rad}$$

Now what is the angular speed after 10 seconds?
$$w = at + w_{i}$$

Now its speed after 10 revolutions?
$$w^{2}_{f}-w^{2}_{i} = 2a\Delta \theta$$
