A *200 g* mass is attached to a *spring* with *k = 150 N/m*. We compress the spring *4 cm* and release with *no friction*. 

1. Find the angular frequency and period of the oscillation.
$$w = \sqrt{\frac{150}{0.2}} = \sqrt{750} \frac{rad}{s}$$
$$T = 2\pi/\sqrt{750}$$

2. Write down the position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time.
Position
$x(t) = Acos(wt - \phi)$ -> $t = 0$ -> $x(0) = -0.04m$
$Acos(\phi) = -0.04$ -> $cos\phi = -1$ -> $\phi = \pi$
