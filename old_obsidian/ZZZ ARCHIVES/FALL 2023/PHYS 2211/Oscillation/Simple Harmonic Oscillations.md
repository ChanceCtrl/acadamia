# Simple Harmonic Oscillation
A SHO repeats itself in a particular way. It can be described by a sin or cos function of time.
$$x(t) = $$

# Simple Harmonic Motion
Period, frequency, and angular frequency are all independent of the amplitude. Thus you can increase amplitude all you like but it won't affect your period. What will affect that however is mass, for example if you double your mass you will double your period. 

## Postion, velocity, acceleration
Max position (with amplitude)
$$x(t) = Acos(wt - \phi)$$

Max velocity (at equilibrium)
$$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -Awsin(wt - \phi)$$

Max acceleration (at max positions)
$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -Aw^{2}cos(wt - \phi) $$

## Mass Spring System
### Newtons 2nd law
$$\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} = -w^{2}x$$

### Energy
#### Kinectic
$$K(t) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}m(wAsin(wt))^{2} = \frac{1}{2}mw^{2}A^{2}sin^{2}(wt)$$

#### Potential
$$U(t) = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} = \frac{1}{2}k(Acos(wt))^{2} = \frac{1}{2}kA^{2}cos^{2}(wt)$$
