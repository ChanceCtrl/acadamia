## Uniform Circular Motion
The velocity of a point moving in a circle will be perpendicular to that circle and thus constantly changing. Thus the acceleration must be going towards to the center point. That is called centripetal acceleration

Angular velocity (w) is change of angle over time.

The radical component is nothing but $$a_{r}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$$
The tangential component is simply: $$a_{t}=|\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}| = |\frac{dv}{dt}|$$

Now shit gets freaky
$$F_{cp}=ma_{cp}=m \frac{V^{2}}{r}$$
The centripetal force is the net forces in the system which points toward center of the circular path.
$$F_{cp}=\sum F_{r}$$
That is: Find all forces in the system.
**The "centrifugal force" is not a real force**. A stationary observer finds now outward force. The observer who is moving with the object on the circular path, interpret its inertia (tendency to keep its velocity until another force acts on it (newtons laws)) as centrifugal force. _It is a pseudo force from pov of a non-inertial frame_
