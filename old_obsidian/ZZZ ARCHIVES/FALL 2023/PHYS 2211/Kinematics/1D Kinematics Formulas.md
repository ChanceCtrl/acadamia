Some formulas for [[1D Kinematics]].

### Constant Velocity
Position at time T: $$x(t) = V_{i} + x_{i}$$

### Constant Acceleration
Velocity at time T: $$v(t) = at+v_{i}$$
Position at time T: $$p(t) = \frac{1}{2}at^{2}+v_{i}t+x_{i}$$
Time independent acceleration: $${v^{2}}_{f}-{v^{2}}_{i} = 2a*delta(x)$$

### Breaking apart 2D into 1D
Velocity X component: $$v_{i}cos(theta) = v_{ix}$$
Velocity Y component: $$v_{i}sin(theta) = v_{iy}$$
Range: $$\frac{v_{i}^{2}sin(2theta)}{a}$$



### Trig functions to remember
Length of vector: $$c = sqrt({a^{2}+b^{2}})$$
Some identities: $$tan(m)=\frac{a}{b}$$
Find angle of opposite:$$sin(m)=\frac{a}{c}$$
Find side length of opposite:$$a = c*sin(m)$$
Find angle of adjacent:$$cos(m)=\frac{b}{c}$$
Find side length of adjacent:$$b = c*cos(m)$$
