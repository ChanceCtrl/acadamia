Different observers can measure different velocities for a moving object. We need to attach our chosen coordinate to some object.

We work based on Galilean Relativity. At extremely high speeds near the speed of light we have to switch to Einstein's Relativity.

$$v_{ba}=v_{bo}- v_{ao}$$

We can generalize the formula to 2D and then 3D, but it wont be required.
