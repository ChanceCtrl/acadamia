$$x = \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$[x] = [a t^2]$$
$$L = [a][t^{2}]= [a][t]^{2} = \frac{l}{t^{2}} * t^{2} = L$$

x = displacement
a = acceleration
t = time

In a circular motion we figure that the acceleration changes with speed and radius of the circular path. Now the question is how does the  dependency look like?

$$[a]=\frac{l}{t^{2}}$$
$$[v^{mr^{n]}=}[v]^m[r]^n
=(\frac{l}{t})^{m}*l^{n}
=\frac{l^{m+n}}{t^{m}}$$
$$m=2    m+n = 1$$
$$ n=-1$$
