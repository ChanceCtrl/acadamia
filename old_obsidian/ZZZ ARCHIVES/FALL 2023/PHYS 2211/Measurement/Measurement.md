### We are constantly measuring things
Theories mean nothing without observation and measurement 

### A measured quantity comes with a unit unless it is a ratio




# Fundamental Quantities
| Time               | S    | <- Base three |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------- |
| Length             | M    | <-            |
| Mass               | Kg   | <-            |
| Temperature        | K    |               |
| Electric Current   | A    |               |
| Substance Amount   | mole |               |
| Luminous Intensity | cd   |               |

***Everything can and should be converted back into the base three or SI wack***
*Angle has a unit, but its not fundamental as it is a ratio of two lengths*

## Base Three definitions
1 Second : Duration of 9,192,631,770 full periods of a specific radiation of Cesium-133 atom
1 Meter : Distance traveled by light in 1/299792458 seconds 
1 Kilogram: Mass of a prototype in Sevres in France, measured and made based on accepted physical constants.

## Unit Conversions
### Rules
Quantities add or subtract only when they have the same unit
wack divide and multiply as the quantities do
Terms on two sides of an equation and must have same units
Trigonometric, Logarithmic

## Dimensional Analysis
"Dimension" denotes the physical nature of a quantity. the distance between two points for example, can be measured in feet, meters, or furlongs, which are all different units for expressing the same dimension that is length.

### Rules
Quantities add or subtract only when they have the same dimension
The dimensions divide and multiply as the quantities do.

x/y = z                  \[z] = \[x]/\[y]
z = x^2                  \[z] = \[x^2]
A cube is *L^3*
\[v] = \[dist]/\[time] = L/T
