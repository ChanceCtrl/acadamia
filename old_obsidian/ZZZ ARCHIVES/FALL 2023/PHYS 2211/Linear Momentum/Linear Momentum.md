Which situation brings about more damage?
- A passenger car moving at 35 mph and a passenger car moving at 70 mph
- A passenger car moving at 35 mph and a van moving at 35 mph

Both mass and velocity matter here.

# Linear Momentum
We define linear momentum as a vector quantity: Mass times velocity.
Newton called it the quantity of motion
$\vec P = m \vec v$ and its derivative $$\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \frac{d(m \vec v)}{dt}$$ and if m is constant $$\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$ and if it isnt

We just revisited Newton's law of motion in a new form:
$$\vec F_{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$

**Total momentum is conserved in any collision**
$$m_{1}\vec v_{1i} + m_{2}\vec v_{2i} = m_{1}\vec v_{1f} + m_{2}\vec v_{2f}$$
Or if they stick
$$m_{1}\vec v_{1i} + m_{2}\vec v_{2i} = (m_{1} + m_{2})\vec v_{f}$$

## Non-Isolated Systems
The new form of Newton's law of motion says, the total force acting on a system is equal to the rate of change in its momentum.
$$\vec F_{net} = \frac{d \vec P}{dt}$$
Integration gives us
$$\int_{0}^{\Delta t} \vec F_{net}dt = \vec P_{f} -\vec P_{i} = \Delta \vec P$$

$\vec I = \Delta \vec P$ is called impulse. The faster an impulse is exchanged, the larger the force.

This new form of Newton's law of motion says the total force acting on a system is equal to the rate of change in its momentum. This allows us to get the Impulse by looking at the area under the momentum curve.

## Isolated systems
If the boundary of the system is chosen so that is has no interaction with its surroundings.

### Conservation of Linear momentum for an Isolated systems
We define linear momentum as a vector quantity: $\vec P = m\vec v$
$$\Sigma \vec P_{i} = \Sigma \vec P_{f}$$

If we only look at the small time intervals before and after the collision, the system can be considered isolate; **Then the total momentum is conserved.**

# Types of collision
## Elastic Collision
The total kinematic energy of the system is conserved.
$$K_{i1} + K_{i2} = K_{f1} + K_{f2}$$

### Neat formula
$$v_{1f} = (\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})v_{1i} + (\frac{2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})v_{2i}$$

$$v_{2f} = ( \frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} )v_{1i} + (\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})v_{2i}$$


## Inelastic collision
Some or all of the kinematic energy is lost through work of non-conservative forces. 
$$K_{i1} + K_{i2} \text{  !=  } K_{f1} + K_{f2}$$
or
$$\Sigma K_{i} \text{  !=  } \Sigma K_{f}$$

Almost all collisions around us are inelastic.

### Completely inelastic collision
The colliding objects stick together after collision and move together. In this case the kinematic energy is maximally lost.

## Explosions and deployments
Explosions and deployments follow the same rules as the collisions. if the system is isolated then the total momentum is conserved and the kinetic energy might be conserved or not.

If the system is dismantled by conservative forces and the system maintains its total mass, the mechanical energy of the system is conserved.

$$M\vec v_{i} = \Sigma m_{n}\vec v_{nf}$$
