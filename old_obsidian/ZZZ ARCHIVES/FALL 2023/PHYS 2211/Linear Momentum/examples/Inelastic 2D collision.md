A car with mass $m_{c} = 1200kg$ is moving east and collides with a yellow truck with mass $m_{t} = 3000kg$ that is moving north with a speed of $v_{t} = 15 \text{m/s}$. The two collide and lock together after the collision. What is the magnitude of the initial velocity of the car? The wreck skidded at an angle of $\theta = 60$.

Conservation of momentum
$$\vec P_{1i} + \vec P_{2i} = \vec P_{1f} + \vec P_{2f}$$

Conservation of momentum of the car/x axis
$$x: m_{c}v_{c} + 0 = (m_{c}+m_{t})v_{f}cos\theta$$

Conservation of momentum of the truck/y axis
$$y: m_{t}v_{t} + 0 = (m_{c}+m_{t})v_{f}sin\theta$$

Solve
$$(3000)(15) = (4200)v_{f}sin(60)$$
