A billiard cue ball collides with another ball on the table which is initially at rest. The speed of the cue ball just before the collision is 3m/s. After the collision the cue ball deflects at an angle of $\theta = 30$ from the original direction. Assuming the balls are identical, what are the speed and direction of the second ball?

Conservation of momentum in X axis
$$x: m_{1}v_{1i} = m_{1}v_{1f}cos\theta + m_{2}v_{2f}cos\theta$$

Conservation of momentum in Y axis
$$y: 0 = m_{1}v_{1f}sin\theta - m_{2}v_{2f}sin\phi$$

Conservation of kinectic energy
$$\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1i}^{2} + 0 = \frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1f}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2f}^{2}$$

So we use the $sin^{2}\theta + cos^{2}\theta = 1$ thingy and apply that thinking to Y we first square both sides
$$m_{1}^{2}v_{1f}^{2} sin^{2}\theta = m_{2}^{2}v_{2f}^{2} sin^{2}\phi $$
Same for X
$$(m_{1}v_{1i} - m_{1}v_{1f}cos\theta)^{2} = (m_{2}^{2}v_{2f}^{2}cos^{2}\phi)$$
And add them to get 2 unknowns
$$m_{2}^{2}v_{2f}^{2}(sin^{2}\phi+cos^{2}\phi)$$
$$m_{2}^{2}v_{2f}^{2}(1)$$
Then continue to do some freaky shit, tbh idek.
