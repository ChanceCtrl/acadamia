A 1kg box sliding on a friction less surface at 3 m/s, hits a 2kg box at rest. The bounce off and move in opposite directions afterwards. Can we calculate final velocity of each object after the collision?

Nope, we have two unknowns both being final velocity as the two cubes bounce off at different speeds.
