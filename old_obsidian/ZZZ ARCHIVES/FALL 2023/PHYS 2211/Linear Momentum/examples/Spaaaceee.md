Imagine an astronaut is moving with a speed of 0/2 m/s away from the space station. The Astronaut has 60 kg of mass and only has a wrench with mass 0.4kg, and she is out of air thrust. How fast does she need to throw the wrench to save her life?
$$P_{i} = m_{1}v_{i} + m_{2}v_{i}$$

We need $v_{1f} > 0$

$$P_{f} = m_{1}(0) + m_{2}v_{2f}$$
$$\vec P_{i} = \vec P_{f} = m_{1}v_{i} + m_{2}v_{i} = m_{2}v_{2f}$$
