# Non inertial or accelerating frames
An inertial frame is a frame of reference which measures zero acceleration for an object which in not under influence of any force.

# Example of a non-inertial frame
You are in the bus and it accelerates or decelerates or turn. Is the force you are feeling an actual force like tension, friction, normal force, or gravity? What is it?

## Get pranked 
It is just inertia, and you feel it or observe it only because you are in a non inertial frame of reference.

## How to solve
We must add fictitious forces to solve the problem from the POV of a non-inertial observer.

# Another example of a non-inertial frame
Artificial gravity by rotating doughnut. There is no real thing as centrifugal force. Its a fictitious force which simulates inertia.
