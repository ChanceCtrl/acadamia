# 1. A body will maintain its velocity if no net force is acting on it.
This is also called the law of inertia.
The tendency of an object to resist any attempt to change its velocity is called inertia.
An object can move at a constant velocity without an net force on it. Aristotle did not think so and for about 2000 years after him people believed that objects naturally come to rest. Galileo said **NNAAAHHHH**.

# 2. The net force on a body is proportional to the resulted acceleration through a scalar called mass of the body. 
$$F_{net}=ma$$

# Forces in Classical Physics: Non contact forces

## Gravitational Force

g is the gravitational acceleration of objects due to earth. therefore the force of gravity becomes
$$F_{g}=mg$$

![[Newton's universal law of gravity]]

**But it is only 9.8 m/s^2 near the surface of earth.**

## Electromagnetic Force
We will not study it in this course, just know that it is responsible for all contact forces in next two slides. 

## Normal Force
Always perpendicular to the contact surface. It is the reaction of surface to the net force pushing against it. It must be found. Basically the reason you cant physical touch anything.

## String Tension
Tension force is everywhere inside a string and it pulls both sides.
If the string is mass-less and solid, and in pulley systems when the pulley is mass-less, the tension has the same magnitude on both sides. 

## Frictional Force
Always applied on the object opposing the net force that is trying to move the object on a surface. Friction exists only if there is a non-zero normal contact force between the two surfaces. **There is also a reaction force toward the other object in contact**. **Dry friction** is what we study in this chapter. Resistive forces when an object moves in a fluid is also considered frictional force. 
$$f = mueN$$
When you push a box and it doesn't move that is **static friction**.

### Static friction & Kinetic friction
Until the surfaces are stationary relative to each other, the static friction increases with the force applied parallel to the surface
$$F_{f}=-F$$
The threshold (maximum) static friction is modeled
$$f_{s,max} = \mu_{s}N$$
Once the system starts moving the kinetic friction comes into play
$$f_{k}= \mu_{k}N$$

## Spring Force
Always opposes the change of length of the spring
$$F_{s}=-k(\Delta x)$$

## Free body diagram
The object is represented by a particle with the mass of the object centered at the center of mass of the object. All forces are sketched from this point attached by the tails.

# Pulley systems
Pully systems help us to lift/hold/move the objects easier. Acting like a gear ratio of sorts.

# Banked Curves
Banked curves provide more centripetal force and centripetal acceleration, and so allows a faster turning speed.
$$\Sumation F_{r} = ma_{cp} = m \frac{v^{2}}{r}$$

## Radial and tangential Accelerations
Consider small segments on any curved path. Each segment can be imagined as a part of a circle.
