Any two massive particles m1 and m2 placed at a distance r, are attracted directly toward each other through a force of magnitude. 
$$F_{g}=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$$
where gravity is
$$G = 6.67*10^{-11}N. \frac{m^{2}}{kg^{2}}$$

# Gravitational forces follow superposition rule
Every two elements of two objects exert gravitational force on each other and the direction of these forces are different
