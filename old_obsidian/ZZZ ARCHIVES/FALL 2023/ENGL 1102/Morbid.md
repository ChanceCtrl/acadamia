**The two hosts are just kind of casually talking about murders, just vibin, promoting their merch, talking about their friends and how excited they for this episode and comparing it to their past favorites. Kind of fucked up ngl, but who am I to judge?** We have 2 main people, Richard (23 from cali, passive, and into horror-core music went by cyko sam) and

**ad break (this was just a hard cut to some podcast, and another hard into another podcast ad, I mean I understand if you are 187 episodes in you have your audience hooked ig)**

Emma Niederbrock (16, interested in the occult, played soccer, went by Ragdoll). They first met thru Melanie Wells (18, sweet, best friends with Emma, met Richard thru horror-core) **((How long is the character intros going to take? we are 25 minutes in?))**

Music break **(marks the end of character intros?)**

**I lied** now we are getting the Emma family lore dump. **Lots of talking but not a lot of reason as to why? Why do I as the listener care about how their parents relationship with Emma? Or how that when Emma met Richard it didn't work?**

**The two hosts continue to talk about personal anecdotes, and how they relate to Emma. Early 2000's internet common experiences go brrr.**

Emma's mom calls Sicktanic the Soulless to figure out where Emma is, he says that Emma and Richard made it home from the concert they went to, and not to worry. 

Emma's mom calls the house and Richard picks up, she quickly picks up that is lying that everything is fine, so she calls for the police to do a welfare check, they find nothing wrong, she gets Richard to call for the police to check the basement they find nothing wrong. **The whole time this is happening the two narrators are just kind of bouncing along with the story beats like they are watching some B-grade horror movie for funsies** The police finally enter the house, and find 4 bodies that have been horrifically murdered. The night before they figure that Richard had been the one behind it he crashed Emma's brothers car and only gets ticketed for driving without a license. **The hosts talk about the murder weapons and the general initial investigation**

lil audio sfx **(Interesting way to mark the start of a court case lol)**

Lmao Richard plead guilty and got out of the death penalty. **The hosts then proceed to roast the shit about Richard for the next 10 minutes, honestly understandable.**

# Take away
The way the hosts bounce off of each other is more interesting than something like serial and atlanta monster. The much more chill not edited nature of it lends it to focus more on the narrators as well. Now should this vibe be around the topic of a brutal murdering of 4 people? Probably not, but its more interesting for me the person forced to listen to it.
