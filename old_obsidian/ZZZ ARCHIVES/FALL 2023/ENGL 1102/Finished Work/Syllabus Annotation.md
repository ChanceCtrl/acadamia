THESIS: You are in charge of your education. You are adults. Figure it out. 
 

1. Checking your email is key to communication with the way KSU is structured. You are an adult. 
2. Technical issues do not absolve you from anything, even when D2L’s servers go down and you cannot login, and you are responsible for receiving emails in any circumstance. So, figure it out. You are an adult. 
3. Attending class is important to learning. Multiple studies agree with this idea according to most professors.
4. You must make sure D2L does not send you assignments into nothing and I will not tell you when they do. So, figure it out.  
5. You must keep up with your grades. I will not tell you; you are an adult. Fair.
6. Drop the class if you are failing before your midterm. 
7. You must participate in class each day and do the work that was given. You had a week so it's not like you have an excuse, and it is very well communicated in D2L. You are an adult, figure it out. Aside from the 5 other classes with the same idea. 
8. If you do not take notes in class, you are not learning anything and thus do not get full credit for being there.
9. Once I have said this, I will not say it again, I put in the same effort you do, figure it out.
10. There is group work, so work in a group, otherwise get a bad grade. 
11. Sometimes things happen, but that does not matter, do what you need to do anyways and do not complain, you are an adult. 
12. 3 credit hours mean 6 hours of work per week, but really, it’s 7.5 because it’s hybrid and you do not get extra credit hours for the extra work, multiply the credit hours by 3 to for the total hours per week in class and out.

People in 1101 and 1102 struggled with this. These expectations are not rare. They are the minimum expectations of an adult in college. 

If you use AI to figure it out, you will fail, if you are in a group and use it, you will all fail. You are an adult, figure it out by yourself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was going to be a very needless “analysis” of the syllabus out of spite. But I have like 3 other classes that need homework done, so I probably shouldn’t.
