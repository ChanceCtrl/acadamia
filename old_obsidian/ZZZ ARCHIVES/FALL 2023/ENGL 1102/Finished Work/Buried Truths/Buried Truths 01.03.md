To sum up the last one, 3 guys tried to vote.[[Jon Harris]]'s family were fearing for their life, [[Dover Carter]] got beat for it, and [[Issea Nixon]] was shot 3 times for it.

[[Dover Carter]] looks at the state [[Issea Nixon]], realizes that no authority this far south would do a thing, and thus heads to Atlanta to tell the FBI.

Then the podcast decides to go back and re explain what happened to this point thru the memos that [[Dover Carter]] gave to the FBI.

After he finished those they would be sent off to the FBI office in Savannah & Washington DC. Soon after that the largest POC newsletter in the south.

September 10th comes by, and [[Issea Nixon]] dies.

The current sheriff thankfully saw this as a murder, and made a statement that [[Issea Nixon]] was in fact shot for voting. This was a very important choice of words. But now the [[Jonson Brothers]] are claiming self defense from [[Dover Carter]] and [[Claude Sharp]] is saying he never saw shit. 

Back to the FBI agent. He is looking for a reason for federal charges, namely conspiracy. He writes to [[Jay Edgar Hoover]] that the beating of [[Dover Carter]] and the shooting of [[Issea Nixon]] appear to be related. [[Jay Edgar Hoover]] left out the keyword and sent it off to his boss. 

A reporter from the Pittsburgh Courier (the largest POC newspaper) heads on down south to the land of traitors dressed as a shoufer and starts to ask around about [[Issea Nixon]]. 

Now we cut to an interview with Sally, [[Issea Nixon]]'s wife. She found it odd that she couldn't go with him to vote as [[Issea Nixon]] was cautious that day.

Then it cuts to [[Issea Nixon]]'s funeral. [[Darthy Nixon]] was kid, she was confused why someone would do this, she was angry how this happened. She would run and hide from anyone coming, she would have nightmares about hiding behind the house. 

It cuts back to the FBI in DC, they don't even think its a conspiracy. So they decide to lay low on the case and let the state go first. They did not go well. The Jury was all white men (who are thankfully all dead now) and the case didn't even get a transcript. 

And then another recap

So the [[Jonson Brothers]] defense is that they were just minding their business when [[Dover Carter]] provoked them into beating his ass senseless and then when they finished their drive to offer [[Issea Nixon]] a job, [[Issea Nixon]] pulled a knife on them and they had to shoot him three times. Both counts of self defense, no one testified. The previous prosecutor called out sick, and gave the new one only 3 days to prepare. The case was a farce, and a complete failure of the justice system. The [[Jonson Brothers]] got away unpunished.
