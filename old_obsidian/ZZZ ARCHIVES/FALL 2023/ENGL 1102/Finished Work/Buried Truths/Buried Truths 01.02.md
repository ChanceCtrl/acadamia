Voting day. Its a big thing in a small town like Austin, but we mostly only care about 3 people, [[Issea Nixon]], [[Dover Carter]], and [[Jon Harris]].

[[Claude Sharp]] waved to the group of voters, and [[Jon Harris]] knew him, and decided to go visit. 

Now sheriffs of this time where overall, not very good people. Corrupt, unchecked, and raciest is a bit of a wombo combo so to speak and one can figure that [[Jon Harris]] is not going to get away with actually using his rights unchecked. 

[[Jon Harris]] walks up to the sheriffs car. [[Claude Sharp]] says "If you know whats best for you, don't vote", [[Jon Harris]] retorts "Well maybe you don't know whats best for me". [[Jon Harris]]'s wife caught on quick, hid their kids, and got to work fortifying the house. Their daughter remembers it quite clearly.

Meanwhile [[Dover Carter]] used his truck to ferry people to and fro the polls to help as many people vote as possible. This means that soon the KKK will start to pull up, and threaten violence with 4 words "There he is now". 

[[Dover Carter]] didn't just inspire the men tho, he got some people's wifes' also involved to go to the polls. 

But now the KKK/raciest were getting active again, while he was ferrying people to the polls a black sedan flew past them and blocked the highway. They were here kill [[Dover Carter]]. "We are going to beat the hell out of you" they said. [[Dover Carter]] had a shotgun, but the other cunt also had a gun, so he had to take it. The beating was so severe that he was bleeding and had a broken wrist. He called out "Lord have mercy", and they stopped beating him. They left on the condition that he stopped ferrying people. [[Dover Carter]] talked to the election officials and asked for help. And then he went home.

[[Issea Nixon]] was on his way home from voting with his mother. [[Darthy Nixon]] was working in the field when she heard a car pull up. It was the [[Jonson Brothers]], parked in front of the barn and waited. One of the brothers just got done beating [[Dover Carter]]. They called out for [[Issea Nixon]].  One had a shotgun pointed toward the house, the other jumped [[Issea Nixon]]'s fence. They asked if he voted and who for. After hearing his answer the [[Jonson Brothers]] insisted that [[Issea Nixon]] go for a ride with them. After [[Issea Nixon]] refused, the [[Jonson Brothers]] took aim, and started firing. The [[Jonson Brothers]] ran off and his wife picked [[Issea Nixon]] up and brought him inside. He was badly wounded.

After getting a family friend with a car, they would have to drive to Dublin Georgia as that was the closest hospital that would take African Americans. It is a an hour long drive today with paved roads and they were not paved in the 1950's.

[[Dover Carter]] is protected by his family, friends, and members of his NAACP chapter. He wakes up the next morning to go to the nearest hospital, the same one [[Issea Nixon]] is at. [[Dover Carter]] sees him, and they talk. 

[[Dover Carter]] was faced with a choice, go back home and keep at what he was doing, or set his sights higher.
