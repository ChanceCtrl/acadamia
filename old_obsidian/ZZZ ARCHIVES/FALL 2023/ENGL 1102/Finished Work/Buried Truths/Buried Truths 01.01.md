Something tragic happened in Austin (south Georgia) to the Nixon family. They owned a farm that was about 59 acres, traveled by horse and wagon, and relied on a mule named Della. They were a simple, wholesome, farming family. Until 2 fucking white guys pulled up with pistols in their hands, asked to see [[Issea Nixon]] (Head of the family) asked him if and who he voted for, **and then fucking shot him**. 

It was the 1950's, fresh off of WW2 African American men were coming home and were slapped with the same racial bullshit that they left.

Austin was tiny little county in the middle of no-where but it had a pretty sizable market of things. The Nixons contributed to this market, they had a field of crops and a field of trees, and would often travel into town to sell their goods.

[[Issea Nixon]] worked the farm often and thus had a lot of time to think about things, like his kids. And he wanted the best for his kids, which would be a pretty tall order in the south in the 1950s. [[Eugene Talmadge]] especially had issues with this.

[[Darthy Nixon]] was [[Issea Nixon]]'s daughter. She remembers helping on the farm and doing other kids activities like trying to make wine under the house.

While all that was happening, another African American started to make moves, and his name was [[Primus King]]. He wanted to "Put the bell on the Cat's neck" by being one of the first few African Americans to vote. The democratic primary's where often only offered to white people and he was going to change that.

He walked up, asked to vote, and got turned down. He then walked down the street and got a lawyer to sue the democratic party for denying his vote because of race and color. It was in the newspaper by that afternoon. And he soon had threats after that.

He went to court, he won, there was an appeal, the supreme court overruled it. He won. This was great for the African American population in the south at large, their voter registration sky rocketed, but it also kinda directly led to the death of [[Issea Nixon]]. And quite a few others as naturally [[Eugene Talmadge]] had a problem with this. 

A guy named [[Dover Carter]] started a NAACP (Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People) chapter back in Austin. One of his first few converts was [[Issea Nixon]]. I mean things were really looking up for minorities to start voting.

Then [[Eugene Talmadge]] met with his KKK friends and wrote one word "Pistols". Soon after he gave a speech and motivated idiots to do stupid shit. Why? Because they may get a different democratic governor. 

One of the first few things they did was to remove African American names from the lists of registered voters. Or pressured out of registering, or shoot. The FBI figured around 50,000 names were purged or otherwise prevented from registering. Soon the FBI was swarming the state to prevent the rampant voter fraud. Soon it went from name purging to death threats, and sometimes more. Soon after [[Eugene Talmadge]] won. But he would never live to take office. Good fucking riddance. 

That wouldn't stop the racial violence tho, and a chain of violent acts against minorities were committed over the next few months.

Harry Truman took office after FDR and was the first president to acknowledge the exsistance of the NAACP. This would not be an easy sale in the south. But as rich fucking white people do they pitted the poor white people against the poor African Americans and watched them destroy each other. This still happens today. Fuck rich people. 

Now [[Eugene Talmadge]] wasn't done yet, he had a little hell-spawn of a child that was still running governor. Now the KKK knew they had a friend in high places and got ballsy. This led to [[Issea Nixon]] voting out of spite, and getting shot from fucking idiots that lap up any excuse for why they are having problems so long as it wasn't their fault.
