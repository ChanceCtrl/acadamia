[[Jon Harris]] considered [[Claude Sharp]] his friend. 

It wasn't uncommon for kids to be friends despite color, but the racial divide would grow quickly after high school starts. Sometimes these friendships could last past that but it grows unnaturally. Because for some reason if you have a different skin tone you aren't human. Can we please stop with this podcast? Like yea I know that it is important to understand history so that we don't repeat it (we are going to anyways) but there is only so many times I need to hear about people being so bloody stupid.

If [[Claude Sharp]] wasn't a racist dirt bag, then why didn't he stop the beating of [[Dover Carter]] instead of saying he didn't see a thing and if he did it was not in his capacity to intervene. 

None of it makes any sense, its all backwards, twisted and built upon by paradoxes. 

Anyways the [[Jonson Brothers]] wanted to go beat up [[Issea Nixon]] in the woods, supposedly not kill him. They told [[Claude Sharp]] they were going to do this as they were his first cousin. 

Back to [[Dover Carter]]. He was thinking about moving north and worked with a paper in order to raise money. It wasn't to stay under constant threat, but it was enough to move out to his brothers. They only had 1 room for their family, no kitchen, and a singular stove. A similar thing was happening to the Nixon family. 

Adjusting was hard for the two families. But the NAACP came in clutch and started to help out as the state of Philadelphia won't give aid to families until they live there for a year or more. [[Dover Carter]] isn't getting great jobs tho and the help from the NAACP was drying up. Someone eventually got his truck up to him. And with this he got some odd jobs, could get around to interviews, and eventually started his own produce company. After that he was able to find stable ground and his family was quite well off. 

Now to the Nixon family. They may have been forgotten if it wasn't for the Pittsburgh Courier. They started a thing to build the Nixons a home and furnish it. After a bunch of stories from some important people in POC journalism started to come out, some money started to come in. They eventually had enough money to build a 5 room house in a nice location. Then instead of thanking the people for donating all that money on their own accord, they main person behind the Pittsburgh Courier, Jessy Van, said that was all because of [[God]]. 

Then Sally Nixon was invited onto a show to attest to Jessy Van's character.

After some time the Nixon family tried to find [[Issea Nixon]]'s grave, but they couldn't. They knew the general area in which he was buried but there was no marker, no headstone. 

Also [[Darthy Nixon]] was thinking about killing some white guys. She never really got over it, but she understood it wasn't healthy. She was given a task to make a girl talk, it took an entire year but eventually she did. And with that she got an A, a job offer, and a key to get out of the mindset she locked herself in.

The FBI would show up later to help unlock the past as well.
