It matters as the BLM movements are based on a similar story of lack of trust in the police

But I dont want to listen to more episodes
Mostly because we spent the entire bloody semester listening to more or less this same story

It doesn't really connect with me, I grew up in the middle of nowhere as a little white kid, racism wasn't exactly a thing for me...

The host is hardly there lmao
