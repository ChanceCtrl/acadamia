The narratives still support racism tho

# Introduction

Racism again

True crime is based on racism, but now its just white on white crimes (Why do they keep repeating themselves?)

The narratives still support racism tho, and more people want other people to watch it for comfort in the pandemic??? (I mean it is just the bloody abstract with 1 or 2 more sentences????)

This article will look at said racism in true crime narratives and their overall deceitfulness (please don't tell me the entire article is just going to be the same bloody 3 paragraphs with different wording)

# A Brief History of American Danger Narratives

White people in early america where racist. What a shock. I am truly baffled, like I could have never guessed. This is a revelation of epic proportions. I am shaken to my very core. And they made false narratives that reinforced those ideas?? Oh my sweet baby jezums how could they? Its almost like... like they were awful people, but how could they have a bad take if they were american? this is too much for me right now I think I need some fresh air lest I faint. 

They built a statue for a women who slaughtered children and brought their scalps back as a trophy...

people being racist after slavery was abolished

And people are still racist and construct false narratives to vilify anyone that isn't them. (I am getting too lazy to be sarcastic this article is just draining).

# A Brief History of True Crime Narratives

The line between fiction, true crime, and journalism can get blurry, but its still racist. 

True crime narratives "tell a story that is true but in the manner of one that is not"

Its over....

That was the most redundant thing I have ever had to read ever.
