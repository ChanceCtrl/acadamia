Bealive it or not, true crime podcasts are in fact popular. But they focus too much on the deranged people who commit the crime, and this brings question to the morality of the genre while blurring the line between informative and exploitative.

The writer felt creep-ed out by the story told by "American Murder: The Family Next Door" saying that it was too personal. Or at least they should've been, turns out they liked that more personal perspective of the victim. 

Its a fairly novel thing for True Crime, most just cover the murderer and never really bring up the murdered.

The part that makes "American Murder" more ethical, is that its more easy on the victims families.

They give an example of unethical true crime being "Making a murderer" and how it got a second season that was supposed to be a follow up to the wrongful conviction of Steven, but in doing this they forgot about the person murdered? They aren't the focus anymore??? Like my g what? They also left out evidence that wouldn't be good for their point. That's a much more fair point.

Now they just talk about how true crime brings people together. They then give an example of someone who went missing, had a podcast made about them, and found the muderer.

Overall they start to spiral into how the community aspect of true crime, and try to link it back to "American Murder".
