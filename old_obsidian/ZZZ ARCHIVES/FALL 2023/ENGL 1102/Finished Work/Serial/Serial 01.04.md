We know when the two detectives shifted their look into [[Adnan Syed]] from [[Mr. S]] because of a voice memo at a court room. They talk about how they got this anonymous report from an Asian male (18/21 years old, unclear on east or south Asian). In short they just said look at [[Adnan Syed]]. He hangs up and then calls back a little bit later just to say that Adnan's friend said that Adnan said that if he did ever hurt one of their girlfriends he would drive the car into a lake, and that [[Yasuar Ali]]. They cant trace the call as its out of range and three days later the two detectives meet with [[Yasuar Ali]] at a pizza place. He says he didn't make that call, and that he didn't know anything. He was asked where would Adnan ditch the car if he did. Yasuar said most likely the forest or something. No one knows who made the call.

A few days later the two detectives get a supena for [[Adnan Syed]]'s phone records and this is what really cracked the case for them. It was a map for their murder they thought.

Jenifer was called 6 times that day, but Jenifer was a friend of [[Jay]]'s not Adnan. So they went in for an interview.

She says that [[Jay]] called her on Adnan's phone and told her that Adnan had killed [[Hae Min Lee]]. She left that day thinking that she was now a suspect and thus came back the next day with an attorney and her mother. Now the story was that [[Jay]] called her asked her what he should do, Jen asked if he was involved Jay said no, [[Adnan Syed]] just showed me the body and I dropped him off somewhere in the city. And at some point [[Jay]] was picked up by Jen at some best buy parking lot. After getting in the car [[Jay]] mentions that the shovels used to bury [[Hae Min Lee]] were from his house and that he knew where they were left. He threw away his old clothes and wiped the handles from the shovels. 

After Jenifer tells her side of the story they go to pick up [[Jay]] from where he works. At first Jay tells them nothing, but then he says alright ima come clean, and gives them the same story Jenifer said, but now he knows where [[Hae Min Lee]]'s car is.

After that they get a warrant out for [[Adnan Syed]]'s arrest. Adnan remarks on how he isn't really that close to [[Jay]] and doesn't understand why Jay would lie. 

Nah bro [[Jay]] just said that quote "I am the criminal element of Woodland High".... WHY?? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT IN A COURT MY G?????? YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY THE LAW??????? ARE YOU IS HAVE THE STUPID?????

Anyways instead of going to the cops he just like, didn't. And for only having one arrest I don't think having dogs put on you wouldn't go on your record please stop trying to be edgy... And instead of calling in anonymous and reporting the call, he just... didn't????? For someone trying so hard to be edgy why is no one looking at him??? He just says he feels bad about it.

Out of the like 6 times [[Jay]] was interviewed details would always shift around. Some where small, like what mall they went to or who smoked, and some where larger like one time Jay said that he and [[Adnan Syed]] where eating when Adnan was called by the police and another time Jay said they were in a friends apartment who's dad is a homicide detective but that he didn't want to get her in trouble. Or that he didn't dig the hole one week and helped the next. And some even larger like saying before that Adnan wasn't talking about killing [[Hae Min Lee]] before hand to another week him saying the Adnan was talking about killing [[Hae Min Lee]] up to 5 days before the strangling like wtf bro keep your shit straight you are making yourself look horrible.

BRO HOW DID HE FORGET WHERE HE SAW A DEAD BODY????

AND WHY ARE THE COPS NOT PRESSING THIS?????????

MY G A FUCKING RAT COULD DO A BETTER JOB.

AND THEY BELIEVE [[Jay]] BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT SOMETIMES?????????

I am fucking done with this episode I cant anymore

Thank fuck its over.
