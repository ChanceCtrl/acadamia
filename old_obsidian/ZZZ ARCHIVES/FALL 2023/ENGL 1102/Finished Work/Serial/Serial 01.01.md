Its hard to keep track of what you did when. What did you do last Friday, where did you go? Who did you talk to? What did you buy? It is hard to remember even with text chat logs or social media and whatnot. That only gets harder as time goes back. So the problem is trying to figure out what [[Adnan Syed]] did for 21 minutes after school in 1999. [[Hae Min Lee]] disappeared in that time when she was picking up her little cousin from kindergarten and drop her off at home, but she never made it. A month later her body was found in a park in Baltimore. Her body was found in a shallow grave by a maintenance worker. [[Adnan Syed]] was arrested for her murder six weeks after she disappeared. [[Rabia(?)]] is also interested in this case and believes that [[Adnan Syed]]'s defense threw the case on purpose so they could get more money from the plea deal. 


The case story went like so [[Adnan Syed]] and [[Hae Min Lee]] were dating but he wasn't supposed to be dating at all. Adnan was a american teen tho and wanted 2 fuk, so he and Hae had to keep in a secret. The state used this against him in 2 ways
1. He put everything on the line to go running around with [[Hae Min Lee]]
2. He lied day in day out to his parents about this

But all teenagers live this sort of double life and doubly so if they have constricting parents, that and there was no evidence, outside of the fingerprints left in [[Hae Min Lee]]'s car that [[Adnan Syed]] had been in many times. Nothing linking him to the crime but [[Jay]]'s unreliable and changing stories that were bolstered with [[Adnan Syed]] phone records.

Adnan was arrested February 28th and took straight to an interrogation room, the same room that [[Jay]] was in earlier that morning. Jay said on the morning of the January 13th Adnan had left school and driven to his house saying he was gonna kill that bitch. A little bit later Jay gets called back to pick up Adnan and Hae is dead in the trunk of a car. After dumping the body Adnan wanted the be dropped off at track practice for an alibi, and was boasting about the murder in the car. 

[[Adnan Syed]] said that he loved her and was sad when they broke up but he moved on like high school love does. 

[[Adnan Syed]]'s stories goes like this. He hung out with [[Jay]] before and after school but nothing of note happened, he just got his close friend and Jay's girlfriend Stephanie a birthday gift which he have to her in second period. He wanted to make sure that Jay got her a gift and went around after school (in the murder window) to make Jay get a present for his girl friend. On the one hand, It was a regular day, why would he remember it? On the the other hand, how convenient, he doesn't remember the day. 


The alibi girl is someone named [[Asia McLain(?)]]. She said that she saw him in the library that day and [[Adnan Syed]] passed the letters she wrote to him after his arrest to his attorney but they said the letters didn't checkout. A basic summery of the letters
1. We talked in the library that day, my friend and boyfriend both saw you
2. General gossip about the school and how they are taking the case

[[Rabia(?)]] called and talked to [[Asia McLain(?)]] about the letters and how no one ever called her. So they try to open some appeal but for some reason [[Asia McLain(?)]] has done a 180 and says that [[Adnan Syed]] is guilty.

The library has video system, but it only lasts a week. They had a sign in paper for the computers, that wasnt logged. And lastly the friend and boyfriend, Jarad had no idea who/what [[Asia McLain(?)]] was and Darek remembers her, but not what happened that day.

Finally a call with [[Asia McLain(?)]] tells us that she does remember the day, and that [[Adnan Syed]] was in the library and that he was remarkably chill, and very not murdery.
She started asking questions about the case. Wasn't there more evidence? No one else saw him? Was there no way he could be proven innocent otherwise?

After calling [[Adnan Syed]], you would think there to be a more positive reaction, but it was too late. She should've come to that conclusion at the re-trail a year prior rather than now.




I swear if I have to hear the same bloody piano effect one more bloody time I get it you like it but like why every ten bloody minutes
