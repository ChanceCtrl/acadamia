Recap
After [[Adnan Syed]] broke up with [[Hae Min Lee]]. It humiliated Adnan and he killed Hae for it. It wasn't a crime of passion it was a crime of pride or so claimed the state.

From middle school Adnan was clumped together with Hae and co in a magnet program so they all took classes together, hanged out, and dated. 

The timeline of their relationship kinda goes like school dance at the start of Jr prom and another school dance at the end.

Adnan asked Hae to prom out of a challenge and she went with it. Typical teenage stuff ensues and they start going out in secret.

[[Iesha Pittman]] remembers when [[Hae Min Lee]] and [[Adnan Syed]] started talking and how she would tease Hae about it. But because they had to keep it a secret Hae would often use [[Iesha Pittman]] as a facade to go hang out with Adnan.

They would have  to page each other to see if they were clear and then call a 1-800 number and transfer the call so it would never ring.

Many of their common friends say that Adnan was a little overbearing in the relationship. He would often page or drop by uninvited but no one thought it was too weird.

Hae doesn't like how Adnan's religion is getting in the way of it, but Adnan thought that it didn't really matter and finds Hae's view on it estranged.

Adnan lied mostly to his mother and she found out fairly quick. She would often study what Adnan was up to see if you was keeping up with his religious shit, none of them really reprimanded him too much about it. Well, until they showed up at the dance and made a deal about it. 

But on the phone about it later Adnan and his friends seemed to laugh and joke about it, so nothing to lead him to kill Hae.

The phone he got 2 days before hand, on the one hand he needed to orchestrate the murder; On the other hand he was excited to be able to talk to girls unimpeded and was proud of the work he had done to get the phone

And the work? EMT, one could say that his experience with that would give him all the knowledge needed to strangle Hae, but he said he took pride in his work and just liked saving old people, plus he probably would've had a more elaborate way to make it look less like him.

All the teenagers wrote dark edgy poetry so that doesn't stick out.

After the dance they broke off for a month, then got back together and then after three days [[Hae Min Lee]] started crushing over some guy named [[Don]]. They started to go out soon after and went on like double dates and did couple things.

[[Jay]] said that Adnan was in a murderous mode after the breakup and jealous of [[Don]]
But then everyone else said that it wasn't really that serious. 

He talked to a lot of girls after Hae and never really seemed stuck over it. At some point Hae had to call Adnan to pick her up and with [[Don]] they both decided that Adnan should drive her back all was fine.

The states case said that Adnan was going to fabricate a reason to get into Hae's car to kill her. But no one saw them leave together. Only [[Jay]] said that he saw him in the car. Some of their mutual friends said that he did ask for a ride tho.

[[Adnan Syed]] talked to one cop and said that he asked for a ride but never got in the car
Then two weeks later he talked to another cop and said that he never asked for a ride.

Why lie?

(He probably just fucking forgot my g).
