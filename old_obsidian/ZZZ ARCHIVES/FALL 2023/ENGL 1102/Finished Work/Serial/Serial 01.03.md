[[Sarah Koenigg]] finds the two detectives who worked the case. One of them turns down the interview and the other believes that [[Adnan Syed]] did it without a doubt.

A quick recap of how the investigation goes
- It starts off slow ([[Hae Min Lee]] is an adult after all, with a car)
- They start by calling around motels and friends.
- Then they start call into the boyfriends as they are suspect #1 
- First [[Don]], next [[Adnan Syed]], Don has a time sheet alibi and Adnan's track coach doesn't remember if he was there.
- They look for 3 days in the forest with the dogs
- After that they find a new suspect

## The new suspect
The man who found [[Hae Min Lee]]'s body at Linchone park. [[Mr. S]] also said he never goes there, but hears about people the go fishing there. He got a job to shim a door but the school didn't have a plane, he had one at home tho so on his lunch break he drives home to grab the tool and some food and starts back to the school. He is drinking and driving until he has to piss and walked **127 feet** into the woods when he looked down and saw hair, and a foot. 

- Why did he walk that far back?
- Why did he choose that log and not someplace else?
- Did he already know where the body was?

No one could find the body, it was very well hidden. And [[Mr. S]] didnt even go to the restroom? He just walked **127 feet back into the woods, found a very well hidden body and just fucking left to work????** . They found a bunch of trash in surrounding area. One of the things would be a bottle. A bottle kinda matching the description of what [[Mr. S]] drinks, so the two detectives start to ask more thoroughly what he drinks and when. But not brandi, what they found at the site. [[Mr. S]] got some polygraph tests, 1st he failed, 2nd time he passed. He may have heard about the murder from someone around him and tried to find the body???
