# How do narrators cultivate a sense of truth?


First paragraph just summarizes Serial's release and how it got [[Adnan Syed]] a retrial. 

If true crime proved popular with the public before serial, what made it stand out? There have been many pieces of true crime media before it and after. They say it made true crime mainstream. It went from chat rooms on back corners of the internet to "Cooler talk". Would this erode a narrators credibility or bolster it?

The narrator tries to cultivate some sense of credibility for them to seem more truthful, but would the masses really care if they were wrong?

If you are only doing a study on the 2014-2015 era that is sure to be off, even if they are "exemplar" of their respective field what passes for the truth on the internet has changed massively in the past few years, how does this affect the public's sense of trust in the narrator.

Taxonomy - is the practice and science of categorization or classification. 

By creating a taxonomy the writer hopes to make future studies easier with a better foundation.

They say that its important to create that taxonomy as true crime reaches its peak.

## Narrators and the Narrative Paradigm

You can't have a narrative without a narrator, so its important that they have credibility.

Homodiegetic narrators are internal to the story while heterodiegetic narrators are not. Homodiegetic can influence the narrative while heterodiegetic only presents the narrative. 

The narrator becomes a key component of the story by influenceing when and what details we hear and thus are Homodiegetic narrators. 

This brings into question the reliabilty of the narrator and their credibility to be talking on the topic. 

Story tellers have always slowly influenced and changed details to make their story fit in the context they tell it in. 

So the narrator is a story teller that is influencing the context and details to make it fit with their audience. 

True crime often uses more homebrew camera production with music to shift the context.

By using narratives you can construct arguments, but in being the narrator you can influence the narrative directly to tell a more compelling argument.

## The Journalist-Turned-Advocate Narrator

[[Sarah Koenigg]] presents herself as an unbaised narrator yet but has a personal position on [[Adnan Syed]]'s guilt/innocence

It should be noted that _Serial_'s podcast format means that, unlike the other case studies discussed in this article, all the arguments are filtered through Koenig's literal voice. Her inflections, timbre, and vocal stylings influence how audiences experience the narrative.

Her narration may complicate her credibility.

She structures the narrative being told to reflect a court case, with one "side" talking about the details that make him guilty and the other "side" talking about how those points are mute, instead of just saying details in a linear fashion.

[[Sarah Koenigg]] claims that she isnt even a crime reporter but she is a reporter for a fairly large entity. She mostly does this to absolve herself of expectations.

[[Sarah Koenigg]] sets herself up in a very advantageous position to deflect any mishaps and yet still keep the audience believing in her narrative.

## The Open Advocate Narrator

The producers control what the viewer can see/hear from a story, and use this control to make arguments for/against things more compelling

The Narrator is much more public with their influence and speaks often, appearing as a very obvious Homodiegetic Narrators

## The Hidden Advocate Narrator

Often the people behind the camera, the editors, directors, other people of the such can have just as much control but in a more subtle and less apparent way. By controlling what sounds play when, the way the timeline of events are presented etc. they can construct a narrative to support their argument out of pretty much anything.

## Conclusion

The way that narrators present their narratives can be incredibly potent and thus it is important to understand their influence. The taxonomy created in this article should help to identify the types of narrators in order to understand what their influence is and to take their bias into account.
