First two paragraphs just talk about how the show is good and a quick summary of the plot. 

Next they talk about how true-crime getting popular birthed the idea of arm-chair detectives. (They have been around since there was a mystery in some chat board in the 90's but ok buddy). Then they talk about the pivot from fictional crimes to true crime. Only the most progressive thinking here... 

Now they are saying the [[Only Murders in the building]] isn't the first to make a parody of true crime bringing up series like American Vandal, A very fatal murder, and the SNL skit about [[Serial]] and immediately pivot to making a murderer and I already had to write some notes on an article covering the "ethics of true crime podcasting" that almost exclusively talked about that so how many times do I have to write the same thing.

They talk about how [[Only Murders in the building]] in the building is much more willing to tackle the ethical quandaries faced by the producers of the genre as they go about creating something that is inherently going to be questionable due to its very nature of taking a sensitive topic with two very polarized sides and trying to determine who is right. And ofc [[Only Murders in the building]] can take the ethical questions, it doesn't have the baggage of an actual murder on its hands to throw around. 

## The sounds, acoustics and logistical considerations

Most true crime stuff starts with a mono log with the writers thesis on the murder functionally. [[Only Murders in the building]] starts out no different, but the setting taking place in a closet makes it more compelling because its more relatable. 

Hold on hold on, let me guess, the next section is going to be something about Serial and the community aspect of true crime stuffs

## The Serial Phenomenon
[[Ethical True Crime Content]]
Yep, there was in fact a [[Serial]] parody with fictions [[Cindy Canning]] being [[Sarah Koenigg]]. And yep, the crew from OMITB got a mini cult like the arm-chair detectives of [[Serial]]. Ooo and now their is a meta podcast about the podcast what a twist that is totally related to the original subject of the paper. 

## Those embarrassing podcast ads

Yep, podcasts need money to continue making more of them. They don't even bring up how this could feel insensitive to the families involved or anything. At this point the title of the paper means nothing and it was all a facade to get me to write way too much. 

## Ethical issues

Wow we can actually face the main topic of the paper.

They say many producers get lost in sauce and over-sympathize with their murderer. Then they say that [[Only Murders in the building]] turns that up by having the reporter being friends with the person dead? But the other paper said that focusing on the person who died was a more ethical take on it? Huh wow its almost like it just fucking isnt how many papers does it take to get to the conclusion that its all give and take there will never be a truly ethical true-crime whatever it is simply paradoxical in nature. 

## The Real Humans Behind the Story

Yep, they were people that had to have their entire life captured in a 40 minute episode.

Crazy bro.

## The Cliffhanger

Yep, [[Only Murders in the building]] is in fact not real and can engineer any amount of murders or situations to make the story interesting. And there is going to be another season? Huh I wonder what will happen. I mean it would be a shame if someone died.

How much of this class has to be about true crime.
