For some reason the start of every episode is some sort of acid trip as this episode starts with [[Charles]] sitting somber in his room, with buggs bunny and the pig character from looney toons behind him as he reads an old valentines card? While he is trippin balls [[Oliver]]'s dog was poisoned and [[Mabel]] is trying to understand what G. M. is.

The three turn their eyes towards Sting, musical superstar as he said he didnt like dogs right before [[Oliver]]'s dog was poisoned and as [[Tim Kono]]'s firm is the one who misplaced his money and thus has motive.

[[Charles]] calls up an old friend related to someone named Lucy who he seems to care for

They run into the bassoonist on the elevator again. She seems kinda sus...

Anyways now they have their meeting with the [[Sarah Koenigg]] oop nope, [[Cindy Canning]]. She says to go in with something Sting cant turn down and to "Embrace the mess". 

Then [[Charles]] starts to trip balls again with Buggs and piggy. I guess these two represent his mistakes with his acting career? His doubt in his self? Or dementia? And then he starts to harmonize with the Bassoonist????

Welp now he is going on a date with said bassoonist. And promptly miffs it, starting to lose his marbles. 

Now starts their interview of sting. They bust in with the turkey, get way too comfortable, and now they are pushing hard. And its revealed that Sting was racked with guilt after thinking he made [[Tim Kono]] kill himself, and not that he murdered him directly.

[[Charles]] with a slightly clearer head goes to talk to the Bassoonist about the truth regarding his last relationship. Getting a second date, he then crashes at [[Oliver]]'s until his son comes in and reveals [[Mabel]]'s connection with [[Tim Kono]].

Hoodie guy starts to follow [[Mabel]] as she follows the lead she found on [[Tim Kono]], [[Cindy Canning]] starts and episode of only murderers in the building, and things start to unpeal.
