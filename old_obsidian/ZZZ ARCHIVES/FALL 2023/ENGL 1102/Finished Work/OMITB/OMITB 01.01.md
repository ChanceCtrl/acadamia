It starts with police storming a building, two old guys running and finding their third, a girl standing over a dead body, covered in blood.

[[Charles]] lives at a place called [[The Arconia]]. He talks to someone about being in an old detective show called Brazzos and is promptly forgotten.

[[Mabel]] talks about sexual assaults in New York and then fantasizes about murdering someone.

Then [[Oliver]] tries to be philosophical and nearly gets ran over. Then he goes back to [[The Arconia]] to pick up some research for something he is writing and bumps into [[Charles]] in the elevator. Soon [[Mabel]] joins the two of them.

Some [[Tim Kono]] runs into the elevator talking on the phone about an important package and gets off. Everyone goes back to their rooms to listen to "All is not okay in Oklahoma" by "Cinda Canning". A fire alarm goes off and they all leave, [[Charles]] then sees a hooded figure going back up the stairs. 

They three of them leave to go to the same restaurant??? and then they all bond over their shared love of "All is not okay in Oklahoma". They get back to [[The Arconia]] and find that [[Tim Kono]] dead on floor 9. The cops think it was a suicide. The three start investigating by finding the garbage bag that [[Tim Kono]] was holding. They find a bag full of suicide notes and think that its done.

But after [[Mabel]] hears about her neighbor getting the wrong mail she goes to talk to [[Charles]] to start back again.

All three open up, Charles is always compared to his dad, problem is his dad is a fucking asshole to women, so he keeps to himself. [[Oliver]] is struggling with money and its straining his family. [[Mabel]] had a pack of friends, but alludes to something going wrong and that keeping to herself is better. 

After [[Charles]] and [[Mabel]]  get into the apartment that has [[Tim Kono]]'s package they steal and open it to find an engagement ring. They start the podcast. 

Then at the end they reveal that [[Tim Kono]] was in [[Mabel]]'s pack o friends.
