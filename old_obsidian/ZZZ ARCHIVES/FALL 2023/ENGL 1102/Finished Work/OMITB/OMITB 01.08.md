This episode starts with some fanatics grouped up outside the building. Wondering when the next episode is going to drop, they get concerned. Little do they know that 2/3rds of the team are currently one bad conversation away from death. 

Teddy, [[Theo]]'s dad, goes on a mono log about how he is disappointed in his son, but how that disappointment has led to him appreciating the silence. Anyways [[Oliver]] and [[Mabel]] get dropped back off at [[The Arconia]] and run into the fanatics. They just kind of glance by, surely they'll be more important later? 

Anyways [[Charles]] and [[Jan]] go over what they got from [[Tim Kono]]'s phone (the password was [[Theo]]). Anyways [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] both describe how they got a death threat and that they need to start moving quicker and with some backing from the police. 

They go to Police lady from episode 6 and she wants a Who, a How, a Why, and a Why now? while she works on some prints on the laptop. Soon everyone converges into [[Oliver]]'s apartment (crew + [[Jan]] + Oscar). They all start talking and come down to the conclusion that [[Theo]] and Teddy did it because [[Tim Kono]] just got his hands back onto the ring that is the linchpin of the investigation to find the truth behind Zoe's death. 

[[Oliver]] was getting food or something when he ran back into the fanatics and he was just kind of like "eh, fuck it" and invited them into the room to help solve it all. [[Oliver]] sets up a whole bloody stage play to put the pieces together. They run thru it, [[Jan]] is still doubtful, and the group votes to kick her.

As [[Jan]] is walking back to her room she finds a note on the door that says "I am watching you". She looks around and enters her room.

They finish the episodes and send the draft to Police Lady. She starts to move the troops while [[Theo]] and Teddy hear about it as the new episode drops for everyone else. They get their guys and everyone is happy, but it isnt perfect, not all the pieces fit.

Like the fact that there are timestamped images of the two outside the building before the fire alarm even went off. And how [[Tim Kono]] was poisoned before he was shot. Oh and now [[Jan]] is dead
