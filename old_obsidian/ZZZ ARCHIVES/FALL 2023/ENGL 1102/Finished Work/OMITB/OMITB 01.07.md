This episode starts with [[Theo]] and his father. He slides out from under a table and his father puts some headphones on him, and plays some music. Slowly he turns up the music to be louder and louder, and his father then starts yelling and getting in his face. Eventually he backs down and realizes his mistake, but its clear that this deeply affected [[Theo]].

We then see a much older [[Theo]] spying on the crew as they talk about what they are going to do next. In other words, mad sus activities for no other reason that could be explained other than he is the murderer. [[Theo]] lurks [[Oliver]] convo with his dad and says to the camera that people talk way too fucking much in this city. 

He talks to the clerk at the desk and bonds by their shared hatred, he calls the front desk to distract him and nabs the key. Breaking into [[Oliver]]'s apartment to get a good pic of their evidence board. 

[[Mabel]] finds a wacky hidden door thing in [[Theo]]'s apartment as [[Charles]] nearly gets caught. [[Theo]] then walks in after both of them exit the secret closet. They scamper off just in time to avoid getting caught.

[[Theo]] talks to his dad about the board and its contents, [[Theo]] is scared that they are catching on but his dad is convinced that he has [[Oliver]] in his pocket so far that he is tickling his balls. His dad scolds him for thinking he isn't capable and he has a flash back.

[[Theo]] is in his secret closet when he sees [[Mabel]] and her Hardy bois breaking and entering, they are walking around n shit and [[Theo]] is watching thru the peep hole when [[Mabel]] [[Tim Kono]] and Oscar walk off, Zoe comes up to the hole and says in fucking sign language to him that he is in fact hot and walks off, while she is dating Oscar and now also knows that he is into some shady shit wtf. [[Theo]] then sees one of the gloves that [[Oliver]] dropped and knows some shit is going down. 

Then another flashback shows Zoe grabbing [[Theo]]'s ass. She walks off signing happy new year and [[Theo]]'s dad stops her to ask if she knows ASL, she says yea but also flashes the ring she fucking stole when they broke in and took it. 

We then cut to [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] following a cart full of crematory containers that they found in [[Theo]]'s fucking closet of secrets. They start lurking around looking at what the person shoving the cart ([[Theo]]) is getting up to. The autopsy person or something is grabbing shit off the body. It turns out that [[Theo]] and his father are grave robbers. Anyways [[Theo]] sees their reflection and starts to chase as [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] start to run. He has yet another bloody flashback to the night that Zoe died. He approches and they start talking about the fight she just had with Oscar. Shes on that antisocial pill, and [[Theo]] is trying to do something I guess. Then it takes a turn for the worst. Zoe starts pushing him around and being as she described "A bitch". [[Theo]] grabs her hand to stop her, she rips her arm away and fucking falls. What a fucking dumbass little cunt that started all of this and for what? and for what? Anyways we see [[Theo]]'s dad threatening [[Tim Kono]] that they will kill [[Mabel]].

All of this is while [[Charles]] is going on a date with the bassoonist. And playing scrabble. And getting freaky. And I don't want to look at that.

Anyways [[Charles]] wakes up from his little thing and see that [[Theo]] is the person who did it. We then see that [[Oliver]] and [[Mabel]] are now both tied up in the back of [[Theo]] White Windowless Van.
