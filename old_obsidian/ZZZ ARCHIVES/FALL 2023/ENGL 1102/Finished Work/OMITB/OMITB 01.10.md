Turns out that [[Tim Kono]] was dating [[Jan]] until she fucking killed him. [[Oliver]] and [[Mabel]] rush to tell [[Charles]] that he was sleeping with a murderer.

He isn't hearing any of it and gets them out. He was throwing away some garbage when he thinks of [[Jan]] and his first date and that's when she knocks on the door, and he also makes the connection with the trash that [[Oliver]] and [[Mabel]] did. Anyways She comes clean about not being first chair and [[Charles]] invites her in. They start drinking and [[Jan]] sees the bassoon cleaner. She starts to panic a little but she already has [[Charles]] drinking. 

[[Charles]] starts a little thing by saying "I think I am falling in love with you", [[Jan]] starts to enact murder plan thing. [[Charles]] however, kinda knows this and plays around it saying that he would love her even if she did kill [[Tim Kono]]. This is when [[Charles]] lays out his cards, He hasn't been drinking shit, he knows that  [[Jan]] is about to try and kill him after drugging him, just like she did with [[Tim Kono]]. She just goes, "eh, fuck it" and comes clean about that as well, she talks about how she thinks the cat died and how she is currently turned on by confessing all of this. What in the hot and crispy Kentucky fried fuck. 

We see [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] investigating [[Jan]]'s apartment, they find her poisons and hear a rattle in the vent. The thing causing that rattle? A knife that [[Jan]] used to stab herself. They also find the emerald ring that [[Tim Kono]] had, all of this confirms that she was the one to kill [[Tim Kono]]. 

[[Jan]] continues to explain how she killed [[Tim Kono]], purposefully getting tiny things wrong in order to have a game of cat and mouse with [[Charles]]. As she continues to kill time the toxin in the handkerchief kills [[Charles]]'s brain. 

[[Jan]] explains how [[Tim Kono]] and [[Charles]] are alike, and how she felt lucky to be let in to their private lives. But [[Tim Kono]] went and started talking to "someone else". She hated feeling second, but loved the feeling of someone begging her for their life. But now that [[Charles]] is drugged and on the floor, he isn't begging. The makes her kinda mad and she gives away that she plans to blow the entire fucking building up using the fireplaces. 

[[Charles]] has been faking the effectiveness of the poison and summons all the strength left in him to stop the recording he had going. This is when [[Oliver]] and [[Mabel]] run to tell him that they were right. He is however rolling around trying to find them. All the while [[Jan]] is starting her plot. Eventually [[Charles]] is found by [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]]. 

They strap him into a stroller and role him into the basement. They figure out that [[Jan]] re routed the natural gas to dump into the ventilation. [[Jan]] pulls up with the fucking strap and has them all at gun point. [[Charles]] gets up to have an epic mono log- sike he is still tripping on the drugs. This lures [[Jan]] into a sense of security as she walks closer until [[Oliver]] pushes [[Charles]] into her ankles causing her to fall and for [[Mabel]] to jump onto her gun before punching her in the face with the ring that started it all. 

[[Jan]] is arrested, [[Charles]] gets his stomach pumped. [[Mabel]] tells the landlord that she is a bitch. [[Oliver]] gets his dawg back. [[Mabel]] is happy with Oscar. Lastly [[Charles]] struggles to send a message to his ex Lucy.

They rap up the podcast, and have a drink. They think about some loose ends, and run out of drinks, [[Mabel]] leaves to go get more and soon the cops show up. Now [[Mabel]] is the next podcast topic about the murder of Bunny, the landlord.
