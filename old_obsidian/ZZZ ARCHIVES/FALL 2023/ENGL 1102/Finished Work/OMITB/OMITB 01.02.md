It starts with an episode of Brazzos. And it gets weird once [[Mabel]] realizes that when [[Charles]] "opened up" to her about why he was alone that he was actually quoting his show. [[Mabel]] is hurt by this and so she doesn't open up about her knowledge of [[Tim Kono]] and just points them in the direction of his memorial. People make a bigger fuss about the cat (Evelyn) than the person (based as fuck).

No one cares about him dying except for people who wanted to use their fireplace and some lady that wanted his room. It is revealed that [[Oliver]] is about to be evicted and [[Mabel]] confronts [[Charles]] about lying, but [[Charles]] doesn't back down. 

Mable goes back to her room and records a brief history of [[Tim Kono]], she met him and he was an asshole, but she liked him because while he was blunt and rude, he never lied. So they became close friends solving little "mysteries" around their building. It was just the two of them until they met Oscar and Zoe. Oscar had keys to the whole building and Zoe pushed people maybe a little too hard. It was fun until the end claims [[Mabel]]. 

[[Charles]] and [[Oliver]] talk to Ursula to try and get [[Tim Kono]]'s list o complaints, they are told to spend $750 on some pyramid scheme and plot to break into [[Tim Kono]]'s apartment with [[Mabel]] instead. They find bloody cat prints from Evelyn.

[[Mabel]] flashes back to the end of her friend group. Zoe was getting cheated on by Oscar, there was some fighting. [[Mabel]] begs [[Tim Kono]] to plead for Oscar's innocence, but he just lie's and runs. Zoe is found dead outside [[The Arconia]]. 

Then [[Mabel]] starts tripping balls and sees [[Tim Kono]] in his room and starts to interrogate him??? And he just fucking vanishes? Then she finds jewelry in all the books.
