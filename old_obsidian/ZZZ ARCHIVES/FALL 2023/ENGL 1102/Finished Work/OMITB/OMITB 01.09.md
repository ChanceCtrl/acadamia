Quick recap, in the last episode they thought that they had their people, The Dimases [[Theo]] and his dad. While they did have a hand in the original murder of Zoe from [[Mabel]]'s group of hardy boys and robbed graves, they could not have killed [[Tim Kono]] at the time that he died. Oh and now [[Jan]] is dead.

Oop sike, shes not dead, she was just fucking stabbed. But they are still making awkward sex jokes even as they talk about leaving [[The Arconia]] (so they must be fine) and thus also leaving the hunt for who killed [[Tim Kono]]. And man [[Charles]] is clingy. 

Anyways [[Charles]]'s old stunt double from Brazzos, Paticki comes into town and now shits awkward lmao. 

We cut to [[Mabel]] and Oscar as they talk about being glad [[Theo]] and his dad are away but still being concerned at who killed [[Tim Kono]]. They are a thing now btw. 

And [[Oliver]] is about to get evicted. And [[Charles]] is getting freaky with [[Jan]] as Patiki takes a call after shitting on him for like 30 minutes. Now everyone is coming to see [[Charles]] and they keep getting jump scared by Patiki and [[Charles]].

Anyways Patiki comes in and breakthrough after breakthrough is making serious progress in like the span of a minute. Turns out it was a crime of passion, where [[Tim Kono]] was drugged as he drank with an obsessive killer that was lonely, poisoned, and then shot. 

Now Patiki is about to steal [[Charles]]'s girl twice thats fucking insane lmao. 

Anyways, no one in [[The Arconia]] is happy with them, any [[Charles]] tries to get the podcast shutdown by himself. But they are still going to get evicted. 

Now they are fighting in the elevator. [[Charles]] just wants out of the podcast to spend his final days with [[Jan]], BUT SIKE PATIKI IS STEALING HIS GIRL YET AGAIN. Sike again, patiki was just changing her bandages, and now they are fighting. 

Oscar leaves to go see his lawyer about getting his name cleared. And [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] go back over everything. They realize that the day they saw [[Tim Kono]] in the elevator, he was taking out someone else's trash. 

Back to [[Charles]] talking to Patiki about how cookie, the girl that was dating [[Charles]] and left for Patiki has now left her, and how she could never understand why [[Charles]] thought so little of himself. She pushes him to go see [[Jan]]'s performance. 

Also according to Mrs. Idoko, [[Tim Kono]] was seeing some girl and when he hit it from the back it made her sing like opera. 

Also turns out that [[Jan]] is no longer the first chair Bassoonist as [[Charles]] figured out after going to her show without her knowing, and also that she left her Bassoon cleaner in [[Tim Kono]]'s sex toy box.
