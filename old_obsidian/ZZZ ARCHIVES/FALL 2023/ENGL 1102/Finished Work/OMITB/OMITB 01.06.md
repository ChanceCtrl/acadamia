This episode starts with a mono log from main cop lady, about being lonely and going out by yourself until she got a wife. Who is into true crime podcasts and she hates that. Probably because it acts as a mockery of detectives. Krill issue on their part. Anyways she dips instead of dealing with explaining the true crime shit idk.

Then we cut back to [[Charles]], [[Mabel]], and [[Oliver]] looking and the jewelry that [[Tim Kono]] bought from the shady jewelry dealer to investigate them. Cutter was supposed to meet with [[Tim Kono]] that day and time but instead [[Mabel]]'s mom shows up.

She scolds her for not moving on from the past, [[Mabel]] argues that she is in fact an adult, [[Charles]] and [[Oliver]] don't make any of it easier but they do get the full story of what happened to [[Mabel]]'s hardy boys and she storms off.

Then we cut back to police lady looking at evidence she never fucking submitted.

Then we cut yet again to [[Oliver]] & [[Charles]] parting ways with [[Mabel]] after her mother yelled at them. They think about how it was unethical to profit off of [[Mabel]]'s suffering or something idk they then get a text from their sponsor and [[Oliver]] asks [[Charles]] to come with him.

We cut for another bloody time to cop lady and she is talking about being alone, until she met her wifey. She tells her about the unsubmitted evidence but how she cant act on it.

[[Mabel]] is now talking to Oscar about what she was getting up to in the time he was locked up. They continue to remenance until they realize that the ring that [[Tim Kono]] was looking for matched the one that Zoe was wearing before she died but that wasn't found on her body. Then right off of that they kiss.

[[Cindy Canning]] then goes on live TV to just fucking harass [[Oliver]] & [[Charles]] podcast lmao. Their sponsor is very happy about this and wants more. They debate about the ethics for a sec and probably take the money.

[[Mabel]] is talking to her mother about seeing the podcast thru. To see the conclusion to finally have some closure and to move on with her life. 

Cop lady then sends the crew some evidence because she isn't alone, she doesn't need her little people in her head anymore.

[[Mabel]] comes back to work with the crew, talking about how she struggles to trust or even like people. They regroup and now their prime suspect is their prime sponsor.
