We get a little bit of a monologue from Tie-Dye Hoodie Guy, and then [[Mabel]] fucking jumps him. Turns out Tie Dye hoodie guy is Oscar from [[Mabel]]'s old friend group. They get in a car heading for long island and [[Charles]] is sent out to follow. 

Its shown that Oscar went to [[Tim Kono]]'s place during the fire alarm and saw, well something we didn't get to see.

Then while [[Oliver]] and [[Charles]] are following [[Mabel]] they call her and she lies about were she was at, making her look more suspicious. 

Then everyone started talking about some past details and making conversation. Soon [[Mabel]] & Oscar get to the Tattoo shop owned by his brother that gave their friend group their hardy bois tattoos. And [[Oliver]]'s car fucking dies.

They get in a car with two guys who have their own podcast called "Yard Dogs". Who have [[Cindy Canning]] as their third Horticulture Homie. 

Anyways Oscar wants to move on with his life, but [[Mabel]] wants to solve [[Tim Kono]]'s death. This divide drives the two away, and they head their separate ways. 

[[Charles]] and [[Oliver]] confront [[Mabel]] and she finally opens up about her relationship with [[Tim Kono]] and her Hardy bois. 

Then Oscar comes clean about the lie about seeing [[Mabel]] the night he got out. He heard the gun shot that killed [[Tim Kono]].

The owner of the tattoo shop comes out and talks about how [[Tim Kono]] was trying to take down a black market jewelry dealer and how he expected to die. [[Mabel]] then shows the group all of the jewelry she found in [[Tim Kono]]'s apartment.
