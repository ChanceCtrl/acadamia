It starts with [[Oliver]] selling a board of people on a new show called splash, it seems to be way too ambitious but he sells them on it anyways.

Then it cuts back to present day were [[Oliver]] has 24 hours to pay until water and power is cut. 

[[Charles]], [[Mabel]] and [[Oliver]] then start to narrow down the list of suspects. [[Charles]] advocates that they narrow down who it isnt. [[Oliver]] says to cut the BS and find who it is, and then it cuts to [[Oliver]] interviewing everyone like its a stage play in his head. [[Oliver]] gives them some recording gear and dips.

Cut to [[Oliver]] talking to one of the people from the board at the start of the episode trying to sweet talk him into funding it. He tries to sell him on the bases of true crime podcasts and then is promptly kicked out. 

[[Charles]] & [[Oliver]] are both talking to Evelyn's owner now and how he is coping at his loss. They press him about how he feels about [[Tim Kono]]. He talks some shit and they try to get him to agree to being recorded and [[Charles]] starts to bleed. Evelyn's owner passes out. He faints at the sight of blood, and thus cant be a suspect. 

[[Charles]] runs into [[Oliver]] in the elevator and they talk about [[Oliver]]'s show. He thinks about selling his last poster for some money, but [[Charles]] gives him some new found motivation and He goes back in to get money.

[[Mabel]] knocks on Mr. Torres's door and tries to find Oscar. She is told off and we cut back to [[Oliver]]. He successfully talks an investor in dropping 35k. Then has the must fucking awkward elevator ride I have ever seen??? for no reason???? He then realizes that they haven't found their prime suspect. Then he gets a death threat. At 4 listens. How. Also [[Oliver]]'s dog is poised and now Stinger the Singer is suspect #1.
