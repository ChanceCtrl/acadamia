exonerated - To free from blame

Since 1989 2,364 people have been wrongfully convicted and over 60% percent of that was wrong person incidents. But some of them are "no-crime" cases where no crime even took place for them to be wrongfully convicted....

wrongful convictions generate a lot of harm that can spread not only inside the family but even to the community at large and can have unintended side affects. Not only eroding trust in the justice system but also leaving the true perpetrator at large.

Their goal in this paper is to examine the number and types of crimes committed by the people where supposed to be convicted. 

# 1 | Crimes of "Wrongful Liberty"
Data on how wrongful convictions contribute to the overall # of violent crimes in america is sorely lacking but predicted to be a very large portion. They estimate that the false cases add anywhere from 1900-6400 additional violent crimes a year. but this assumes that they only commit one additional crime. Some have been recorded to commit up to 20 additional crimes. 

# 2 | Current Study
They restricted their analysis to cases from the Innocence Project, which only have DNA-Based exoneration. This is so that they have a certain degree of certainty that they found the actual perpetrator. Baumgartner and his colleague's recommended “using caution and common sense when working with the data and erring  on the side of under reporting.” After that and a few other filters they were down to 109 true perpetrators.

# 3 | Findings
They present their findings in 3 parts. By using the framework developed by Forst and Huff, they made an educated guess as to estimate the potential harm generated  by the wrongful convictions.
## 3.1 | Factors contributing to wrongful convictions
Most of the cases revolved around sexual assaults, and can be compared with the larger body of DNA-based exoneration's from the Innocence Project. After some wacky data manipulation based on what they could confirm and other widely accepted statistics they were able to generate a graph of how many additional crimes where committed after their wrongful liberty was granted to them.

## 3.2 | Crimes committed by true perpetrators during their period of wrongful liberty
10.4% Drug offenses
12.7% Homicide-related
27.9% Sex offenses
49% Other

## 3.3 | Potential harms of wrongful liberty: Extrapolating from our data
Calculating an exact wrongful conviction rate is impossible; this “dark figure of innocence” (Bedau & Radelet, 1987, p. 83) is “not merely unknown but unknowable”. Kind of a scary quote, but is very important for this paper. They found even with their more conservative numbers that people who where supposed to be convicted on average committed 2.8 more crimes, leading to an average of 20,000-38,000 total offenses.

## 3.4 | Methodological limitations
They say that their result and data should be taken with caution as you can never with absolute certainty guarantee that the Innocence project hasn't also freed some bad people, but that with their filters they should have removed a lot of the feeley stuff and should be left with a hard cold number. That and the records they have access to may not be correct either and some of the true perpetrators may have committed many more crimes. 

# 4 | Discussion and policy Implications
Basically they just talk about how they are the first and that this should have been done sooner...

## 4.1 | Wrongful convictions and crime control: Framing, public opinion and policy making
Mostly just talks about the "Innocence movement" and other things people have been getting up to since the 1990's and how they may affect the ways that they vote regarding these policies and the kind of opposite stance the people in power have.

## 4.2 | Local policy adoptions and implementation: Informed debate and collaboration
The start of this section is mostly talking about new techniques used to help mitigate human errors in memory and things of the sort to put less innocents in jail. Some of the new tech has yet to be used to prevent false convictions out of fear that it may also lead to more people who are guilty getting away with it. The debate on the utility of the new tech centers around the idea that if more truly guilty people are let go they are going to be repeat offenders more times than not. 

# 5 | Conclusion
They have attempted to generate new statistics surrounding the number and the type of crimes the true perpetrators often commit during their time of wrongful liberty. They also debate the number they produced and talk about best/worst case version of it. Some time was also dedicated to discussion of what can be done and what should be done with this info. They conclude that "We can, indeed, reduce crime by protecting the innocent, and out criminal justice system is much the stronger when convicting the guilty and clearing the innocent are accomplished simultaneously"
