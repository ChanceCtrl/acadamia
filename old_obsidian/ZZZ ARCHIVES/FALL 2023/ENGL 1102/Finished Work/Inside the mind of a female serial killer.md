Women, believe it or not, kill. Who could've seen this coming? Not official authorities according to this paper. 

# How are male and female serial killers different?
Most of the time females kill for monetary gain instead of sexual pleasure, usually by poison as compared to asphyxiation. They tend to target people related to them that are vulnerable. They tend to have some sort of proper education, married once, and work in some medical related field, and their serial killer nick-names are more feminine. That last bit actually may explain why they kill in the first place, I mean imagine going into college and being capable just to be sexualized or raped and prejudiced against because you are a women. Thats a fairly good reason to want to kill some people. 

# Your book includes 27 case studies. While researching these cases, did anything stand out?
The most common source of trauma to drive women into serial killers is rape. Makes sense due to the nature of trauma being power imbalance and prejudice. 

# Can you give a snapshot of a female serial killer?
Now they are just giving a recap of how they are different from male serial killers with some more detail. 

# Did any of the cases you included in your book shock you?
The authorities take forever to respond to female killers, funnily enough likely due to said prejudice that spawned them.

# What is the main takeaway that you want readers to know about female serial killers?
That they exists and they get away with it. And that the FBI didn't even count them until the 1990's.

# What do you think our society needs to do to decrease instances of serial killers?
40% of the time serial killers are formed from mental illness. Outside of that there is typical childhood trauma. And outside of that there is lack of police funding to stop them before they get good at getting away with it. (That didn't age well lmao)
