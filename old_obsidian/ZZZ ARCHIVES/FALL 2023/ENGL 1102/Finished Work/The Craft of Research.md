Many researchers fall into the loop of find topic, mass research topic, conclude its inconclusive, and move on. This would pass in high school but in college; Well now they want you to ask a question and answer it. Only nerds read everything around a topic _serious_ researchers however don't document info for documenting info, but instead to support the answer to a question they t-ed up. So instead of being a nerd you should follow _my_ steps because _I am_ better. Start with the who, what, when and where, but focus on the how and why. Ask question about your material but don't answer them yet. Here is an example

## 3.3.1 History
- How does it fit into a larger picture?
- What is its own story over time?

## 3.3.2 Structure
- How does it fit into a larger picture?
- How does it fit into a larger system?

## 3.3.3 Categorization
- How does it group into types?
- How does it differ from things like it?

## 3.3.4 Negative
- Make positive things negative (why?)

## 3.3.5 Question
- How would things be different if it didn't exist?

## 3.3.6 Sources
- If they make a good point, reinforce it.
- If they don't, discredit it.

## 3.3.7 Evaluate
- Ask all your questions
- Look at that list
- Delete half of them
- Weed thru the rest (avoid settled facts, speculation and dead ends)
- Maybe expand scope
- ????
- Profit

# 3.4 _So what?_
Why is your question so important? Huh? Why do you think that this matters and how would you convince someone?

## 3.4.1 Name it
- I am working on \_\_\_\_\_
- Give a name or something

## 3.4.2 Add an Indirect Question
- I am working on \_\_\_\_\_ **because I want to find out \_\_\_\_\_\_**
- This is to make it sound like you have a reason outside of getting a grade...

## 3.4.3 Motivate your Question
- I am working on \_\_\_\_\_ Because I want to find out \_\_\_\_\_\_ **in order to \_\_\_\_\_\_**
- Give agency to this thought or something idk I am so tired.
