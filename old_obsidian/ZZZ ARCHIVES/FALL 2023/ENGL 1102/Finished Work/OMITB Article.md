Written by hulu jumping on a bandwagon. It follows three true crime fans trying to solve a murder at [[The Arconia]]. The person murdered? [[Tim Kono]]. Soon the three true crime fans ([[Charles]], [[Mabel]], and [[Oliver]]) start their own podcast called only murders in the building. As the show grows so do their doubts of each other.

[[Charles]] is a washed up actor that was widely known for his one good role as "Brazzos" in "Brazzos", [[Oliver]] is struggling with money, and [[Mabel]] seeks meaning in life. 

As the show goes on you get more details on how these three came to be the people that they are. The show doesn't just give you all the details however and leaves a lot of it to be an exercise to the viewer. Its this combined with them not using cheap gore to build suspense that makes the show so intriguing.

But the three characters only share a love for a podcast, so how did their dynamic effectively capture people?

Apparently the actors for [[Charles]] and [[Oliver]] are real life besties Martin and Short, so their dynamic works easy. How does this work with [[Mabel]] tho? Lmao they are boomers, and thats all they needed.

Outside of that however, they all struggle with loneliness. [[Charles]] parted ways with who he was seeing, [[Oliver]] drove everyone away with his ambition, and [[Mabel]] is coping with the death of a close friend and the subsequent break up of their friend group. This is somewhat tangential to true crime podcasts always telling a fairly solemn and solitary tail. This show just makes that more interesting. 

Show good go watch.
