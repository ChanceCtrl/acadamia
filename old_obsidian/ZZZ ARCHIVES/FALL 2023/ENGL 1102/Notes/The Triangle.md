# Ethos
credibility -> speaker (i.e: we the audience trust [[Sarah Koenigg]] for how the podcast is structured and her credits in journalism and high production quality)

# Pathos
appeal to emotion -> the audience (i.e: we the audience *feel* a certain way because of the tone, pacing, editing and other structured bits.)

# Logos
appeal to logic -> using evidence to create logical arguments (i.e: Self explanatory.)

# Balance
It is important to strike a balance between the three as a lack of any part can undermine another and make some argument or point fall apart.
