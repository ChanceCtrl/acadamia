# Light = wavelength * freq
$$c = \lambda * \nu$$
(btw $c = 2.998 * 10^8$)

# Energy transition formula
$$\Delta E = -R_{H}(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{f}}- \frac{1}{n^{2}_{i}})$$
(btw $-R_{H} = 2.18 * 10^{-18}j$  = Rydberg constant and $n_{f}$ being final state of the electron and $n_{i}$ being the initial state)
