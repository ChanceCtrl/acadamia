# Precision vs Accuracy
## Precision
Its getting a bunch of values that are close to each other but may not be close to the truth

## Accuracy
Its how close your values are to the actual truth

# Random Error vs Systematic Error
## Random
Shit could be anywhere high or low, its a random distribution

## Systematic
Always higher or lower with very few deviants

# Notations of Number
### Standard
Write down each digit

### Power
0.5 * 10^6 instead of 500000

### Scientific notation
Power notation but "a" (your coeffecient) has to be between 1 and 10
5 * 10^5 vs 0.5 * 10^6 yet both are 500000

# Significant Figure
## sig figs
Basically how many digits matter
4.96*3* has 4 sig figs
15.*2* has 3
9.*7* has 2
etc

### The last guy
The last digit is called the "uncertain digit" or "guessed digit"

## Captive zeros
if there is a zero in the middle then its called a "captive zero" and it gets counted as a sig fig
4.503 has 4 sig figs and 1 captive zeros
3020.004 has 7 sig figs and 4 captive zeros

## Leading zeros
Zeros not in-between data are not counted as sig figs
btw .004963 and 0.004963 both have 3 leading zeros

## Trailing zeros
Zeros after data that are manually listed are counted, but if needed then not. Ie
4.980 has 1 trailing zero and 4 significant figures.
500.00 has 4 trailing zeros and 5 significant figures.
6000 has 3 trailing zeros and 1 significant figure. (bc no decimal)

# Error propagation
Quick example, you need the sq ft of a room and you are given the length and width as 123.4 and 67.5 respectively

## What you cant do
l x w = 8329.5 right? Nah, you forgot that your inputs are only accurate to +-.1 feet due to sig figs

## Then what do you do?
so calc the min and max of the room using those ranges provided
l_min (123.3) x w_min (67.4) = 8310.42
l_max (123.5) x w_max (67.6) = 8348.6

we now see the change happens in the tenths place, so take the average and round to there
1. (A_max + A_min)/2 = 8329.51
2. 8330
