# Waves n shit
## The formula to care about
$$c = \lambda * \nu$$

(btw $c = 2.998 * 10^8$)

## Wavelength: $\lambda$
Distance between identical points on waves (like peaks or troughs)

## Frequency: $\nu$
Number of waves that pass a particular point in a second

## Amplitude
How much of peak is the peak from the mid-line

# Line Spectra
Emission of light only at specific wavelengths

Often achieved by applying power to an element till shit (electrons) starts to glow (move around)

You can tell how many electrons/charge is from the wavelength of the emitted light (shorter freq = higher energy)

## Ground state
Lowest possible energy level for an electron (its resting state)

## Excited state
Any level ***above*** the ground state, so some change in the position or count of the electrons

## Energy formula for these transitions
$$\Delta E = -R_{H}(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{f}}- \frac{1}{n^{2}_{i}})$$
(btw $-R_{H} = 2.18 * 10^{-18}j$  = Rydberg constant and $n_{f}$ being final state of the electron and $n_{i}$ being the initial state)

# Maybe Mass is just Wavelengths???
*L. de Broglie* thought that moving things behaved like waves.

The takeaway from this is $\lambda$ for particles is called the de  Broglie wavelegnth

$$mv = h / \lambda$$

# Certainly uncertain
*W. Heisenberg* thought that you cannot tell the position and velocity of electrons at the same time.

So all we can really do is figure out where an electron *might* be, nothing is certain

# Quantimania
### Principal quantum number
The *Principal quantum number* (n) designates the size of the orbital, the higher the further away.

The energy can be characterized by higher n and higher L means more energy

#### Angular momentum quantum number (L)
The *Angular momentum quantum number (L)* describes the shape of the atomic orbital inside of the Principal quantum number. ***Only certain Angular momentum quantum numbers are in different Principal quantum number (L <= n - 1)***.
0 = s sub level (sphere)
1 = p (pills)
2 = d (dumbells)
3 = f (flower)

You can also get how many electrons are going to be in an atom with the formula $2 * (2L + 1)$.
breaking down that formula you multiply by 2 by L and add one to get the Magnetic quantum number, then multiply that by 2 as 2 electrons can fit into each arrangement of the orbitals.

(0 at the top and 3 at the bottom)

##### Magnetic quantum number ($m_{L}$)
The *Magnetic quantum number ($m_{L}$)* describes the orientation of the orbital in space. The value ranges from -L < 0 < L

![[Pasted image 20240605082739.png]]
(-L on the left < zero in the middle < L on the right)

###### Electron spin quantum number ($m_{S}$)
The *Electron spin quantum number* ($m_{S}$) describes the spin of an electron that occupies a particular orbital. ***Electrons will spin opposite of each other if in the same orbital***

Can only be $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$

## Electron Configuration
How electrons are distributed in the various atomic orbitals

![[Pasted image 20240605092850.png]]

#### Pauli Exclusion Principle
No two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers; and no more than 2 per orbital

#### Aufbua Principle
Electrons fill according to the orbital energies (lowest to highest)

#### Hund's Rule
The most stable arrangement for electrons in orbitals of equal energy (degenerate) is where the number of electrons with the same spin is maximized
