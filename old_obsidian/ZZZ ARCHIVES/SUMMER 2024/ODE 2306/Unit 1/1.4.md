Take $\frac{dy}{dx} = -6xy$, Shit looks wack doesn't it? Here is what to do with it.

# Separate X and Y
Get the Y on one side and the X on the other with their dy and dx also over there.
$$dy * y^{-1} = -6x * dx$$

# Then integrate
$$\int dy * y^{-1} = \int -6x * dx$$

into

$$ln|y| = -3x^{2} + C$$

which is the **implicit** solution, and in this case we can solve for y and express it *explicitly*
$$y(x) = +-e^{-3x^{2}+c}$$
