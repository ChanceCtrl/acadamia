# Fukin derivatives
The rate of change of a function

## differential equations
Its a equation relating some unknown function and its derivatives

# The problem
In solving dif eqs, you need to figure out what unknown functions are operating on what interval of some real numbers and ideally find all answers to it.

## Some examples 
### Example 1
If C is some constant
$$y(x) =  Ce^{x^{2}}$$
then
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = C (2xe^{x^{2}}) = (2x) (Ce^{x^{2}}) = 2xy$$
from this everything is "satisfied" and thus the solution is
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy$$
for all x

#### Side note
Bc its a constant C, there is a an infinite family of solutions, one for each value of what ever you want C to be

### More examples
Newtons law of cooling is wack and here is the function
$$\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - A)$$
k is a positive constant, and something wacky about this is how if T > A then dT/dt < 0, so the thing is cooling, but if T < A then dT/dt > 0 so the thing is heating up.

#### What you need to do
If we are given values for k and A, we should be able to find an explicit formula for T(t), then with that formula be able to predict the future temperature of the thing

### Even more
So we got some fuckin bacteria, it can be modeled by $P(t) = Ce^{kt}$ and at time $t = 0$ the size was about 1000 and the population doubled after 1 hour

From those wacky words we can get 2 equations
$$1000 = P(0) = Ce^{0} = C$$
$$2000 = P(1) = Ce^{k}$$

from this we can see that $e^{k} = 2$ so $k = ln(2)$

with this value of K we can see that our population diff eq is
$$\frac{dP}{dt} = ln(2)P = 0.6931P$$

and now we sub that back into the original equation to get a particular solution of
$$P(t) = 1000 * 2^{t}$$

#### Closing notes or something
And now we can use that to predict future sizes at given times, the thing is that C could've equaled anything, so it being 1000 is unimportant to anything but our individual solution.



# The deets
## Existance and Uniqueness
You make make diff eqs that have so real number solution, they can also only have 1 solution

## Order
The order of a diff eq is the highest derivative in it

# General form
The most generic form for some nth-order diff eq with some independent variable x and the unknown function/dependent variable y is
$$F(x, y, y', y'',...,y^{(n)}) = 0$$
where F is a specific real number function of n + 2 variables

# Initial Value Problems
Most of applied math will be this with the general form of
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y )$$
with some initial condition of $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$
that's the initial condition whether or not $x_{0} = 0$
