# Pack voltage debate
## Does it matter that its 600v?
short: no
long: MRAX 228 max voltage is 580, and most hub motors have a range from 350v to 750v.

# Cylindrical cells
While they maybe small by themselves, the supporting infrastructure makes them stupid large, the main solution to this is to stagger the cells. 

## Why not 18650s over 21700?
### We have to fuse the batteries anyways so why does it matter?
short: cell configurations are easier for 600v.
long: 21700s have low P counts but high energy density, so its easier to run them in series for high voltage and you don't have to worry about capacity as much. The problem is that the 21700s don't scale well for a lower voltage pack, so you would have to target a higher voltage, and its the opposite for 18650s. 

# Pack cells
## Temps
Basically you jam a thermistor into the pack and read that. 

## Packaging
Either foam in a compression fit deal or racks that they slide into, you just want to give them room to expand when they get hot and you still need to hold them in place.

## Lifespan
Depends on how hard you run them (ie dont run them like Hytech).
Its more likely a pouch can die than a Cylindrical, but the capacity probably wont fall off.
Unlikely that either would fail however, and so long as you rip out failing pouches before it gets too bad, all should be good. 

# 13AH vs 20AH
13ah would be better for 600v car
20ah would be better for 300v car
