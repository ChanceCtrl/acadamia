# Beveled edges
In short, the corners on the new lid being rounded is a problem as it wont seal

## Rounded single panel vs Flat panels
### Sealing
The problem with sealing the rounded panel is that when you rely on an interference fit the gasket material around the bend is going to cause excess deflection from the forces generated by the bolts. This excess deflection will cause the seal to not seal and water to enter.

The flat panels wouldn't have the issue of bolts perpendicular to each other generating weird forces on the the bend, thus creating a better seal and not dealing with any wacky forces. It would however generate more possible failure points by nature of it just being more panels.

#### How much would this deflection mater?
Math has not been done, just a basic sketch by Bailey.

#### We would still hit it with silicon anyways.
This wouldn't fix the issue with excess stress and that shit will start breaking from the wacky load, but it would prevent water ingress, however we would still do that on the flat panel as well.

### Serviceability
One main rounded panel would make it stupid easy to get into and service the things inside of it while also making everything very visible. 

Flat panels would have frame rails thus making it harder to get your hand in it and also blocking the viewing angles. This could be fixed by making the frame rails also removable, but this would add to the complexity of the system.
