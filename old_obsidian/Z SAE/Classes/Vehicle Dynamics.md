# Sus components
- Dampener, Spring coilover
- Tires make the car go round

# Contact patch

# Tire pressure
- Tire pressures can dictate a lot of performance factors

# Lateral Force
- Sideways force
- Created on tire contact patch
- most important during cornering
- when we reference grip, this is how we measure it

# Slip Angle
- How lateral force is generated
- Rubber is elastic, tire stretches at contact patch
- This patch creates the lateral force

# Camber
- Tilt of the tire relative to the chassis
- Comes from vehicle roll during cornering
- Camber is not a state element, changes during corners
- Each tire has different sensitivity to camber

# Normal Force
- Weight put onto the tire from the vehicle
- Important in increasing tire contact patch size
- This is where we get into the concept of aerodynamic down force

# Tire Testing
- Tires are run on sandpaper belt
- Testing machine moves to simulate vehicle movement to extract slip angle data
- Data variables: slip angle, lateral force, longitudinal force, pressure, temperature, load sensitivity, etc.
- Design around tire

# What we currently run?
- Hoosier LC0
- Hoosier is only tire manufacturer in our series
- Widely available
- "Softest" compound in series
- If this interests you, let me know there is a potential tire investigation to be done.

# Oversteer, Understeer
- Has to do with the distribution of grip front to rear
- Over-steer = more grip in the front than rear
- Under-steer = more grip in rear than front

# Toe
- The static orientation of the tire
- Drastically affects handling because it affects the slip angle therefore the grip of that wheel
- Toe in towards the car, toe out is the opposite
- Generally, Toe in increases the oversteer

## Toe Adjustment on RWD
- Front toe out:
	- Decrease Accel:

# Corner Balance
- Changes the static corner balance will affect the normal force being pit on that side of that car
- Like camber, corner balance is something that will change thought dynamic events 
- We run a balanced setup (No bias left or right)

# Vehicle Coordinate System

# Vehicle Forces
- Forces associated on each vehicle axis
- Only dealing with Yaw for purposes of class
- Result of generated tire forces

# General Design
### Rod ends in (B)(S)ending
- Apply any axial loads onto the rod end on tits threaded portion runs the risk of failure
- The best way to ensure this is taken into account is 

### Consider Dynamic Degrees of alignment
- Every component in suspension will receive some force given a load case
- Anticipate how those forces might alter the orientation of that component when its receiving that load
