# What are kinematics
- the best way we can think about the kinematics of a car is the skeleton of the car that make up the performance capa

# Car architecture
## Wheelbase
- Wheelbase is the length of the car long wise and is measure from the middle of the wheel
- The main notes for Wheelbase is generally a longer wheelbase increases straight line stability and area effect but increases car weight when cornering

## Track Width
- Track width is the length of the car from the front side
- The main consideration is weight and again cornering inertia, here we can also consider frontal area for aero affects

## Out Board Geom
### Caster
- Side view angle at the wheel on the steer axis and measured in degrees from the well center line
- The main consideration is its effects on steer camber, ride height change, and jacking
- It is defined by the upper and lower control arm

### Mechanical trail
- Mechanical trail is the distance between the caster and wheel center line
- Usually you don't design for this and its an affect of caster

### Kingpin Inclination
- The steering axis from the front view
- Like caster it is measured in degrees from the center of the wheel

### Scrub Radius
- The length created by kingpin inclination and wheel center line
- Identical to mechanical trail just in a different plain
- The main consideration for

# Suspension movement
## Roll
- Roll is the front view sway of the car, and occurs mainly in cornering
- Roll is important

## Pitch
- Pitch primarily happens during longitudinal braking and acceleration

## Heave
- Heave is less intuitive than the other suspension motions outlined
- Heave is upward motion

## Considerations
- While on track we see differing amount of these maneuvers at the same time

# Suspension geom
## Front View Swing Axle
- The consideration for FVSAL is camber change in roll and heave
- Instant Center height defines how much tire scrub out geometry gets

## Camber Change in Roll/Heave
- If there is one thing we can easily quantify and master is suspension and vehicle dynamics its camber change in roll and heave

## Pitch center
- Same method as RC but from the side view of the car

## Control Arms
- 4130 Cromoly Alloy Steel

# Tire Data
- Like everything in engineering we need to define where we have out limiting facotrs
- Unless we want to start funding out own company to build out own compounds (all mighty dollar), we start design at the tire

# Control Arm Geom
- Cannot stress the importance of control arm geom

# Suspension forces
- Pushrod, pullrod
