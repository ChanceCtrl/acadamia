#motorsports 
Part of the process in which we solve engineering problems
- We don't just start building
- Research, Analysis, Math must be done
- Part of the competition


# Why do we document
"Material that provides official information or evidence that serves as a record"
- We use all the "ORs"
- Information
	- Place to store design info
		- Why a part is designed the way it is
	- Others know how parts of the car are being designed
- Evidence
	- Proves that proper engineering process has been followed
- Record
	- Ability to track designs across generations
	- Look back at older design to follow methods
		- Improve upon said methods

# Teams
- Take rules test and pay dues for access
- Where meetings take place
	- Monday meetings
	- Design Reviews
	- Catch up if you missed Monday meeting
- Main storage of files
	- Design
		- Project Proposals
	- Competition Submissions
	- Data Logs
	- Training Guides
- Essentially is the location of all important files

# One Note
- General Space for notes
	- Each subgroup has a section
- Debriefs
- Tracking
	- Project Proposals
	- Project
	- Manufacturing
- Car Logs
	- Space to track issues
	- Failures
	- Notes from testing sessions
- Old one Notes available to look back

# PDM
Cad storage
- CAD Strorage and Management
- Linked with Solid Works
- Each car organized in assemblies based on Cost Report Organization

# Github
Code storage
- Code Storage
- Control Code
- MATLAB Scripts
- Parsers

# Project Proposals
Overview:
- Located in Teams
- Our template for organizing designs
- 5 part system
- failure analysis
- presented during design review
- 3 sub-sections
	- Mechanical
	- Circuits
	- Tests

## Part 1:
- Outlines the project
- what is  the improvement to the car
- how is it beneficial in terms of points
- Rules
- Goals of the project

## Part 2:
- Explanation of part/improvement
- Compiled Research
- Compiled Calculations

## Part 3:
- 3D model
- detailed calculations
- FEA/CFD results
- Verification of improvement

## Part 4:
- Part in main assembly
- Manufacturing plan
- Drawings
- Order lists
- Justification

## Part 5:
- Explanation of failure point
- Testing
- Diagnosing Process
- Solution
